1,"willI've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
2,waymarHow close did you get?
3,willClose as any man would.
4,garedWe should head back to the wall.
5,royceDo the dead frighten you?
6,garedOur orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
7,royceYou don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
8,willWhatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
9,"royceIt's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again."
10,royceYour dead men seem to have moved camp.
11,willThey were here.
12,garedSee where they went.
13,royceWhat is it?
14,garedIt's …
15,jonGo on. Father's watching.
16,jonAnd your mother.
17,"septaFine work, as always. Well done."
18,sansaThank you.
19,septaI love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
20,"eddardAnd which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on."
21,"jonDon't think too much, Bran."
22,robbRelax your bow arm.
23,"jonrobbQuick, Bran, faster!"
24,casselLord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
25,eddardGet the lads to saddle their horses.
26,catelynDo you have to?
27,"eddardHe swore an oath, Cat."
28,"casselThe law is law, my lady."
29,"eddardTell Bran he's coming, too."
30,catelynNed. Ten is too young to see such things.
31,eddardHe won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
32,"robbLad, go run back and get the rest."
33,"willWhite Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
34,"willI know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry."
35,"eddardnods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block."
36,"willForgive me, lord."
37,"eddardIn the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …"
38,jonDon't look away.
39,eddardKing of the Andals and the First Men …
40,jonFather will know if you do.
41,"eddardLord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
42,jonYou did well.
43,eddardYou understand why I did it?
44,branJon said he was a deserter.
45,eddardBut do you understand why I had to kill him?
46,branOur way is the old way?
47,eddardThe man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
48,branIs it true he saw the White Walkers?
49,eddardThe White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
50,branSo he was lying?
51,eddardA madman sees what he sees.
52,jonWhat is it?
53,theonMountain lion?
54,eddardThere are no mountain lions in these woods.
55,theonIt's a freak.
56,eddardIt's a direwolf.
57,eddardTough old beast.
58,robbThere are no direwolves south of the Wall.
59,jonNow there are five.
60,jonYou want to hold it?
61,branWhere will they go? Their mother's dead.
62,casselThey don't belong down here.
63,eddardBetter a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
64,theonRight. Give it here.
65,branNO!
66,robbPut away your blade.
67,"theonI take orders from your father, not you."
68,"branPlease, father!"
69,"eddardI'm sorry, Bran."
70,jonLord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
71,"eddardYou will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
72,branWhat about you?
73,jonI'm not a Stark. Get on.
74,robbWhat is it?
75,"theonThe runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
76,"jaimeAs your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you"
77,"cerseiAnd you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
78,"jaimeThere was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
79,cerseiWhat if Jon Arryn told someone?
80,jaimeBut who would he tell?
81,cerseiMy husband.
82,"jaimeIf he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
83,cerseiYou should be the Hand of the king.
84,"jaimeThat's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
85,catelynAll these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
86,eddardYou have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
87,catelynI wonder if the old gods agree.
88,eddardIt's your gods with all the rules.
89,"catelynI am so sorry, my love."
90,eddardTell me.
91,catelynThere was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
92,eddardYour sister. The boy …
93,catelynThey both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
94,"eddardHe's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after."
95,"catelynYou can always say no, Ned."
96,catelynWe need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
97,maesterI'm told he drinks all night.
98,catelynHow much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
99,luwinWe've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
100,"catelynIn any case, candles."
101,jonWhy's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
102,"theonIt's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
103,robbI hear the prince is a right royal prick.
104,theonThink of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
105,"robbGo on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
106,"catelynGods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
107,branI saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
108,catelynHow many times have I told you
109,branBut he's coming right now! Down our road!
110,catelynI want you to promise me
111,branI promise.
112,catelynD'you know what?
113,branWhat?
114,catelynYou always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
115,"catelynWhere's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
116,"eddardHey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
117,aryaMove!
118,eddardYour Grace.
119,robertYou've got fat.
120,robertCat!
121,catelynYour Grace.
122,robertNine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
123,"eddardGuarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
124,aryaWhere's the Imp?
125,sansaWill you shut up?
126,"robertWho have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
127,aryaArya.
128,robertOoh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
129,aryaThat's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
130,sansaWould you please shut up.
131,eddardMy queen.
132,catelynMy queen.
133,robertTake me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
134,"cerseiWe've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
135,robertNed.
136,cerseiWhere is our brother? Go find the little beast.
137,eddardTell me about Jon Arryn.
138,"robertOne minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
139,eddardWe both did.
140,"robertHe never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
141,eddardAye.
142,"robertDon't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
143,eddardI'm not worthy of the honor.
144,"robertI'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
145,tyrionMmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
146,rosDid you hear the king's in Winterfell?
147,tyrionI did hear something about that.
148,rosAnd the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
149,tyrionAnd the other brother?
150,rosThe queen has two brothers?
151,tyrionThere's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
152,rosI hear they call him the Imp.
153,tyrionI hear he hates that nickname.
154,rosOh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
155,tyrionClever girl.
156,"rosWe've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
157,tyrionHave you?
158,tyrionThe gods gave me one blessing.
159,jaimeDon't get up.
160,rosM'lord.
161,"tyrionShould I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
162,"jaimeYou've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
163,"tyrionShe has odd cravings, our sister."
164,"jaimeA family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
165,"tyrionI'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
166,"jaimeI thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
167,tyrionClose the door!
168,robertDid you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
169,eddardShe was my sister. This is where she belongs.
170,robertShe belonged with me.
171,"robertIn my dreams, I kill him every night."
172,"eddardIt's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
173,robertNot all of them.
174,viserysDaenerys!
175,viserysDaenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
176,daenerysWe've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
177,"viserysIllyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
178,daenerysNo.
179,"viserysWhen they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
180,"maidIt's too hot, my lady."
181,viserysWhere is he?
182,illyrioThe Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
183,"illyrioMay I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
184,"viserysDo you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
185,"illyrioCome forward, my dear."
186,viserysWhere's he going?
187,illyrioThe ceremony is over.
188,viserysBut he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
189,"illyrioTrust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
190,illyrioIt won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
191,viserysWhen will they be married?
192,illyrioSoon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
193,viserysIs it true they lie with their horses?
194,illyrioI wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
195,viserysDo you take me for a fool?
196,illyrioI take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
197,viserysI know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
198,daenerysI don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
199,"viserysSo do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
200,daenerysI don't know.
201,"viserysWe go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
202,sansaDo you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
203,catelynThen he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
204,sansaHe's so handsome.
205,sansaWhen would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
206,catelynHush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
207,sansaWhy would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
208,catelynHe'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
209,sansaYou left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
210,catelynSansa…
211,"sansaPlease, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
212,benjenIs he dead yet?
213,jonUncle Benjen!
214,benjenYou got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
215,jonLady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
216,"benjenWell, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
217,jonSo take me with you when you go back.
218,benjenJon…
219,"jonFather will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
220,benjenThe Wall isn't going anywhere.
221,jonI'm ready to swear your oath.
222,benjenYou don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
223,jonI don't care about that.
224,"benjenYou might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
225,tyrionYour uncle's in the Night's Watch.
226,jonWhat're you doing back there?
227,tyrionPreparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
228,jonYou're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
229,"tyrionMy greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
230,"tyrionDid I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
231,jonLord Eddard Stark is my father.
232,"tyrionAnd Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
233,jonWhat the hell do you know about being a bastard?
234,tyrionAll dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
235,benjenYou at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
236,eddardThe boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
237,"benjenOf course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
238,eddardHe was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
239,benjenThe two he was with are still missing.
240,eddardA wildling ambush.
241,benjenMaybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
242,eddardWinter is coming.
243,robbUncle Benjen.
244,benjenRobb boy. How are ye?
245,robbI'm good.
246,"catelynIs this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
247,cerseiYes. Lovely country.
248,"catelynI'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
249,"cerseiHello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
250,"sansaThirteen, Your Grace."
251,cerseiYou're tall. Still growing?
252,"sansaI think so, Your Grace."
253,cerseiAnd have you bled yet?
254,"sansaNo, Your Grace."
255,cerseiAnd your dress. Did you make it?
256,cerseiSuch talent. You must make something for me.
257,cerseiI hear we might share a grandchild someday.
258,catelynI hear the same.
259,cerseiYour daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
260,eddardYour pardon.
261,jaimeI hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
262,"eddardYes, the king has honored me with his offer."
263,"jaimeI'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
264,eddardI don't fight in tournaments.
265,jaimeNo? Getting a little old for it?
266,"eddardI don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
267,jaimeWell said.
268,sansaArya!
269,robbTime for bed.
270,"eddardI'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
271,catelynI won't let him take you.
272,eddardThe king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
273,"catelynI'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
274,eddardHow did he get so fat?
275,catelynHe only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
276,"aIt's Maester Luwin, my lord."
277,eddardSend him in.
278,"luwinPardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
279,eddardStay.
280,catelynThis was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
281,eddardWhat news?
282,catelynShe's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
283,"eddardShe's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
284,"catelynLysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
285,"luwinIf this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
286,catelynThey murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
287,"luwinThe king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
288,catelynHe spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
289,luwinA different time. Different king.
290,viserysWhen do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
291,"illyrioIf Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
292,viserysWhen?
293,illyrioWhen their omens favor war.
294,viserysI piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
295,illyrioA Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
296,jorahA small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
297,"daenerysThank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
298,"jorahSer Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
299,"illyrioDragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
300,"daenerysThank you, Magister."
301,"daenerysShe's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
302,jorahThere is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
303,viserysMake him happy.
304,khalNo.
305,daenerysDo you know the Common Tongue?
306,daenerysIs ‘no' the only word that you know?
307,"sandorRough night, Imp?"
308,"tyrionIf I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
309,sandorI didn't pick you for a hunter.
310,tyrionThe greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
311,sandorIt's not hunting if you pay for it.
312,robertAre you as good with a spear as you used to be?
313,"eddardNo, but I'm still better than you."
314,robertI know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
315,eddardI hope I'll serve you well.
316,"robertYou will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
317,"branCome on, you."
318,cerseiStop. STOP.
319,jaimeAre you completely mad?
320,cerseiHe saw us.
321,jaimeIt's all right. It's all right.
322,cerseiHe saw us!
323,"jaimeI heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
324,branTen
325,jaimeTen.
326,jaimeThe things I do for love.
327,"jorahYou need to drink, child... And eat."
328,daenerysIsn't there anything else?
329,jorahThe Dothraki have two things in abundance
330,doreahKhaleesi!
331,irriYour hands.
332,"jorahWe're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
333,viserysI have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
334,"jorahAs you wish, your Grace."
335,"viserysWell, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
336,jorahSelling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
337,"viserysUnder my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
338,"joffreyBetter-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
339,"tyrionBefore you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
340,joffreyWhat good will my sympathies do them?
341,tyrionNone. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
342,joffreyThe boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
343,tyrionOne word and I'll hit you again.
344,joffreyI'm telling mother!
345,"tyrionGo! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
346,joffreyYou can't...
347,tyrionDo you understand?
348,"sandorThe Prince will remember that, little lord."
349,"tyrionI hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
350,"tyrionBread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
351,jaimeLittle brother.
352,tyrionBeloved siblings.
353,myrcellaIs Bran going to die?
354,tyrionApparently not.
355,cerseiWhat do you mean?
356,tyrionThe Maester says the boy may live.
357,"cerseiIt's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
358,tyrionOnly the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
359,cerseiI still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
360,"tyrionWhere's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
361,jaimeTell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
362,tyrionAnd go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
363,cerseiThe children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
364,"jaimeEven if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
365,"tyrionSpeaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
366,"jaimeMy dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
367,"tyrionMy dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
368,cerseiPlease.
369,"catelynI would have dressed, your Grace."
370,"cerseiThis is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
371,catelynI never knew.
372,"cerseiIt was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
373,catelynI am grateful..
374,cerseiPerhaps this time she'll listen.
375,jaimeA sword for the wall?
376,jonI already have one.
377,jaimeGood man. Have you swung it yet?
378,jonOf course I have.
379,"jaimeAt someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
380,jonWe've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
381,"jaimeIs it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
382,jonSoon enough.
383,"jaimeGive my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
384,"aryaThank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
385,jonIt's good you've got help.
386,"aryaWatch. Nymeria, gloves."
387,jonImpressive.
388,"aryaShut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
389,jonI have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
390,aryaA present?
391,jonClose the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
392,aryaIt's so skinny.
393,"jonSo are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
394,aryaI can be quick.
395,jonYou'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
396,aryaI think so.
397,jonFirst lesson
398,aryaI know which end to use.
399,"jonI'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
400,aryaSansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
401,jonI came to say goodbye to Bran.
402,catelynYou've said it.
403,"jonI wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
404,catelynI want you to leave.
405,catelyn17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
406,eddardI have no choice.
407,"catelynThat's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
408,eddardYou can. You must.
409,robbYou've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
410,jonYou Starks are hard to kill.
411,robbMy mother?
412,jonShe was very kind.
413,"robbGood. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
414,jonIt was always my color.
415,"robbFarewell, Snow."
416,"jonAnd you, Stark."
417,"eddardThere's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
418,"jonIs my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
419,"eddardThe next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
420,"robertGods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
421,eddardI've half a mind to go with you.
422,"robertWhat do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
423,eddardYou should have asked me 20 years ago.
424,"robertThere were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
425,eddardI recall a few chances.
426,"robertThere was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
427,eddardBessie. She was one of yours.
428,robertBessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
429,eddardWylla.
430,robertThat's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
431,eddardNor will I.
432,"robertWe were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
433,eddardThe worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
434,"robertTrust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
435,eddardDaenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
436,"robertA knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
437,eddardShe's little more than a child.
438,robertSoon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
439,eddardTell me we're not speaking of this.
440,"robertOh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
441,"eddardBut you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
442,"robertThis Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
443,"eddardEven a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
444,"robertThere are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
445,"eddardHe will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
446,"robertThere's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
447,benjenSit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
448,tyrionRapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
449,jonWhy do you read so much?
450,tyrionLook at me and tell me what you see.
451,jonIs this a trick?
452,"tyrionWhat you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
453,jonUntil your brother killed that King.
454,"tyrionYes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
455,"jonAsk me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
456,"tyrionA bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
457,jonThe Night's Watch protects the realm from...
458,"tyrionYes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
459,"maesterIt's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
460,catelynTalk to Poole about it.
461,"maesterPoole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
462,catelynI don't care about appointments!
463,robbI'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
464,"maesterVery good, my Lord. My Lady."
465,robbWhen was the last time you left this room?
466,catelynI have to take care of him.
467,"robbHe's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
468,catelynWhat if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
469,"robbRickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
470,catelynClose the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
471,robbFire. You stay here. I'll come back.
472,assassinYou're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
473,catelynNo!
474,daenerysHave you ever seen a dragon?
475,"irriDragon gone, Khaleesi."
476,daenerysEverywhere? Even in the east?
477,irriNo dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
478,jhiquiIt is known.
479,doreahA trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
480,daenerysThe moon?
481,"doreahHe told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
482,irriMoon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
483,daenerysLeave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
484,"doreahMen like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
485,daenerysHow old were you?
486,doreahI was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
487,daenerysNine?!
488,"doreahI did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
489,daenerysCan you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
490,doreahYes.
491,daenerysWill it take three years?
492,doreahNo.
493,benjenWelcome.
494,catelynWhat I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
495,maesterThe boy was always sure-footed before.
496,catelynSomeone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
497,"theonSaw what, my lady?"
498,catelynI don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
499,"rodrickDid you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
500,robbThey come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
501,"theonIf it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
502,"maesterWhat, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
503,catelynI don't trust a raven to carry these words.
504,robbI'll ride to King's Landing.
505,catelynNo. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
506,"robbMother, you can't."
507,catelynI must.
508,rodrickI'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
509,catelynToo large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
510,rodrickLet me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
511,robbWhat about Bran?
512,catelynI have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
513,"doreahNo, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
514,daenerysFinish a man?
515,doreahKings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
516,"daenerysWell, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
517,"doreahYou will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
518,daenerysI don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
519,"doreahIf he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
520,daenerysNo. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
521,"sansaPardon me, Ser."
522,"sandorDo I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
523,"sansaI'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
524,sandorHe hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
525,"joffreyHe speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
526,"sansaStay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
527,joffreyMy princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
528,mycahI'll get you!
529,sansaArya!
530,aryaWhat are you doing here? Go away.
531,"joffreyYour sister? And who are you, boy?"
532,"mycahMycah, my Lord."
533,sansaHe the butcher's boy.
534,aryaHe's my friend.
535,"joffreyA butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
536,"mycahShe asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
537,"joffreyI'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
538,"mycahIt's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
539,"joffreyAnd you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
540,aryaStop it!
541,"sansaArya, stay out of this."
542,joffreyI won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
543,"sansaNo no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
544,"joffreyI'll gut you, you little cunt!"
545,aryaNymeria!
546,joffreyPlease don't.
547,"sansaArya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
548,joffreyThen go! Don't touch me.
549,soldierThe wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
550,aryaYou've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
551,soldierIt's a direwolf.
552,soldierI'll check down here.
553,soldierI think I heard a noise.
554,aryaGo!
555,joryMy lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
556,eddardWhere is she?
557,joryShe's been taken directly before the King.
558,eddardWho took her?
559,joryThe Lannisters found her.
560,"eddardRight, get back."
561,joryThe Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
562,eddardBack! Back to the inn. All back!
563,aryaI'm sorry.
564,eddardAre you hurt?
565,aryaNo.
566,eddardIt's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,cerseiHow dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,"robertQuiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,cerseiYour girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,aryaThat's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,cerseiJoffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,aryaThat's not what happened!
573,joffreyYes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,aryaLiar!
575,joffreyShut up!
576,"robertEnough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
577,eddardIn bed asleep.
578,"cerseiShe's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
579,"robertNow, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
580,sansaI don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
581,aryaLiar! Liar liar liar!
582,eddardStop it! That's enough of that.
583,aryaLiar liar liar!
584,eddardStop! Arya!
585,cerseiShe's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
586,"robertWhat would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
587,cerseiJoffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
588,robertYou let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
589,"eddardGladly, your Grace."
590,cerseiAnd what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
591,robertI'd forgot the damned wolf.
592,"soldierWe found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
593,robertSo be it.
594,cerseiWe have another wolf.
595,robertAs you will.
596,eddardYou can't mean it.
597,robertA direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
598,"sansaHe doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
599,aryaLady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
600,sansaStop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
601,eddards this your command... your Grace?
602,cerseiWhere is the beast?
603,"soldierChained up outside, your Grace."
604,"cerseiSer Ilyn, do me the honor."
605,"eddardNo. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
606,cerseiIs this some trick?
607,eddardThe wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
608,eddardThe butcher's boy... You rode him down?
609,sandorHe ran... Not very fast.
610,"kingsWelcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
611,"eddardGet the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
612,"joryYes, my Lord."
613,kingsIf you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
614,"jaimeThank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
615,eddardGlad to see you're protecting the throne.
616,"jaimeSturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
617,eddardVery handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
618,"jaimeI know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
619,eddardYou've chosen your opponents wisely then.
620,"jaimeI have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
621,eddardBut you just stood there and watched.
622,"jaime500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
623,eddardIs that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
624,"jaimeTell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
625,"eddardYou served him well, when serving was safe."
626,varysLord Stark.
627,eddardLord Varys.
628,varysI was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
629,eddardA shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
630,"renlyAnd you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
631,"petyrBut we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
632,"eddardShe has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
633,petyrAll too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
634,eddardPerhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
635,"petyrIt wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
636,"grandI humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
637,eddardGrand Maester.
638,grandHow many years has it been? You were a young man.
639,eddardAnd you served another King.
640,"grandHow forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
641,eddardWithout the King?
642,"renlyWinter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
643,varysHis Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
644,petyrWe are the lords of small matters here.
645,renlyMy brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
646,"petyrMmm, how much?"
647,"eddard40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
648,grandCan the treasury bear such expense?
649,"petyrI'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
650,eddardAre you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
651,petyrI'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
652,eddardHow could you let this happen?
653,petyrThe Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
654,eddardI will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
655,"grandLord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
656,"renlyCounting coppers,"" he calls it."
657,eddardI'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
658,"petyrAs you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
659,"eddardThere will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
660,"varysYou are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
661,"cerseiPlease, it's nearly healed."
662,joffreyIt's ugly.
663,"cerseiA King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
664,"joffreyI'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
665,"cerseiThat's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
666,joffreyDo I have to marry her?
667,"cerseiYes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
668,joffreyI don't want to.
669,"cerseiNo, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
670,joffreyWe allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
671,cerseiHow would you handle them?
672,"joffreyI'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
673,cerseiA royal army?
674,"joffreyWhy should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
675,cerseiAnd if the northerners rebel?
676,"joffreyI'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
677,"cerseiAnd these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
678,joffreyFor me. I'm their King.
679,"cerseiBut you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
680,joffreyI'm not asking.
681,"cerseiThe North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
682,joffreySo you agree... The Starks are enemies?
683,cerseiEveryone who isn't us is an enemy.
684,"septaEnough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
685,aryaI'm practicing.
686,sansaPracticing for what?
687,aryaThe Prince.
688,"septaArya, stop!"
689,aryaHe's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
690,sansaThe Hound killed your friend.
691,aryaThe Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
692,sansaYou're an idiot.
693,"aryaYou're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
694,septaEnough!
695,eddardWhat's happening here?
696,septaArya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
697,"eddardGo to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
698,eddardThe same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
699,sansaI haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
700,septaYou've barely eaten a thing.
701,eddardIt's all right. Go on.
702,eddardWar was easier than daughters.
703,aryaGo away!
704,"eddardArya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
705,aryaMine.
706,eddardGive it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
707,aryaI wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
708,eddardCome here. Now what do you want with this?
709,aryaIt's called Needle.
710,eddardA blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
711,aryaStick 'em with the pointy end.
712,eddardlaughs] That's the essence of it.
713,aryaI was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
714,"eddardNo, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
715,"aryaI hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
716,eddardSansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
717,aryaSo was I! He is a liar.
718,"eddardDarling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
719,aryaBut how you can let her marry someone like that?
720,eddardWell… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
721,aryaWinter is coming.
722,"eddardYou were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
723,aryaI don't hate her. Not really.
724,"eddardI don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
725,aryaI can keep it?
726,"eddardTry not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
727,oldDon't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
728,branI hate your stories.
729,oldI know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
730,branThose weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
731,"oldOh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
732,robbWhat are you telling him now?
733,oldOnly what the little Lord wants to hear.
734,robbGet your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
735,branMaybe we do.
736,"robbHow do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
737,"branI did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
738,robbDon't ever say that.
739,branI'd rather be dead.
740,"rodrickFewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
741,catelynIt's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
742,rodrickMy Lady.
743,"guardWelcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
744,catelynI would. We've done nothing wrong.
745,guardWe've been instructed to escort you into the city.
746,"catelynInstructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
747,"guardFollow me, Lady Stark."
748,petyrCat! Go on. Go upstairs.
749,catelynYou little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
750,petyrI meant no disrespect to you of all people.
751,catelynHow dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
752,petyrNo one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
753,catelynHow did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
754,petyrA dear friend told me.
755,varysLady Stark.
756,catelynLord Varys.
757,varysTo see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
758,catelynHow did you know I was coming?
759,"varysKnowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
760,catelynDo you know whose dagger this is?
761,varysI must admit I do not.
762,"petyrWell well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
763,catelynYours?
764,"petyrAt least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
765,catelynTo whom?
766,petyrTyrion Lannister. The Imp.
767,"alliserIf that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
768,alliserNext!
769,"alliserLord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
770,tyrionA charming man.
771,jeorI don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,"tyrionAnd how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,jeorSlowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,tyrionGood news or bad?
775,jeorBoth.
776,grandLord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,petyrGood news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,eddardMy wife is in Winterfell.
779,petyrIs she?
780,petyrI thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
781,eddardYou're a funny man. A very funny man.
782,catelynNed! [poking her head out of a window]
783,"petyrThe Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
784,"grennYou broke my nose, bastard!"
785,jonIt's an improvement.
786,"grennIf we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,pypI wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,"grennWhat're you looking at, halfman?"
789,tyrionI'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,rastWhat do you care about our faces?
791,"tyrionIt's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,"grennWe'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,jonEverybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,tyrionGrenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,jonThey hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,tyrionIt's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,petyrThe mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,catelynWe have proof. We have the blade.
799,"petyrWhich Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,catelynPetyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,"petyrI'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,catelynI won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,petyrDon't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,cerseiHow could you be so stupid?
805,jaimeCalm down.
806,cerseiHe's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,jaimeI was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,cerseiNothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,jaimeThen what are you raving about?
810,cerseiWhat if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,jaimeWe'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,cerseiAnd my husband?
813,jaimeI'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
814,cerseiLet me go.
815,jaimeNever.
816,"jaimeThe boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
817,catelynI wish I could see the girls.
818,eddardIt's too dangerous.
819,catelynJust for a moment.
820,eddardUntil we know who our enemies are...
821,"catelynI know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
822,eddardLittlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
823,cerseiAnd if you find the proof?
824,"eddardThen I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
825,"catelynMy temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
826,eddardHe still loves you.
827,catelynDoes he?
828,eddardOff with you.
829,robertIt's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
830,"barristanOf course, your Grace."
831,robertWho was it?
832,barristanA Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
833,robertHow'd you do it?
834,barristanLance through the heart.
835,"robertQuick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
836,"lancelIt's empty, your Grace."
837,robertWhat do you mean it's empty?
838,lancelThere's no more wine.
839,"robertIs that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
840,jaimeOne of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
841,"barristanI was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
842,jaimeYou killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
843,"barristanA good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
844,robertYour outlaw... Any last words?
845,"jaimeI cut his head off, so no."
846,robertWhat about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
847,"jaimeHe said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
848,jorahThe Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
849,daenerysFrom whom?
850,"jorahIf you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
851,daenerysTell them all to stop.
852,jorahYou want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
853,daenerysUntil I command them otherwise.
854,jorahYou're learning to talk like a Queen.
855,daenerysNot a Queen. A Khaleesi.
856,viserysYou dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
857,"irriRakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
858,daenerysNo!
859,"irriRakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
860,"daenerysPlease please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
861,viserysKill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
862,"jorahShall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
863,rakharoYou walk. [to Viserys]
864,benjenI wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
865,jonYou're leaving?
866,benjenI'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
867,jonWhat kind of reports?
868,benjenThe kind I don't want to believe.
869,jonm ready. I won't let you down.
870,"benjenYou're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
871,jonBut I'm better than every...
872,"benjenBetter than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
873,yorenA bear's balls.
874,tyrionYou're joking?
875,"yorenAnd his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
876,tyrionAnd how do a bear's balls taste?
877,"yorenA bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
878,"tyrionDo Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
879,yorenBut it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
880,tyrionThey have a better chance finding feed than glory.
881,"benjenThe Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
882,"tyrionYou don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
883,"benjenI hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
884,"tyrionDo you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
885,benjenCall me what you like.
886,tyrionI'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
887,"benjenYou know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
888,"tyrionBut... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
889,"benjenYou're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
890,"yorenAre you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
891,"benjenEnjoy the capital, brother."
892,yorenI always do.
893,"tyrionI think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
894,yorenInto the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
895,tyrionSo you're heading down to King's Landing too.
896,yorenDay after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
897,tyrionLet's share the road. I could use some decent company.
898,"yorenI travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
899,tyrionNot this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
900,"irriYes, Khaleesi."
901,daenerysWhat are you doing?
902,"irriWhen was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
903,"jorahFor a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
904,rakharoDothraki don't wear steel dresses.
905,jorahArmor.
906,rakharoArmor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
907,jorahSlow.
908,rakharoSlow.
909,"jorahIt's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
910,rakharoMy father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
911,jorahI've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
912,"rakharoHe was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
913,jorahHe still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
914,irriThe Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
915,rakharoThere are no rabbits.
916,"irriFind some ducks, she likes ducks."
917,"rakharoHave you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
918,irriDog then. I have seen many dogs.
919,jorahI don't think she wants to eat dog.
920,irriThe Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
921,rakharoA blessing from the Great Stallion.
922,irriShe does not want to eat horse.
923,jorahI'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
924,rhakaroWe ride for Vaes Dothrak.
925,jorahDon't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
926,jonDon't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
927,"maesterHow many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
928,"tyrionEight... no, nine."
929,maesterAll of them brief?
930,"tyrionThey say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
931,maesterThis summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
932,"jeorWe've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
933,"tyrionYes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
934,jeorOne of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
935,maesterThe Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
936,jeorYour sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
937,"maesterWhen winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
938,daenerysIt's a boy.
939,khalHow do you know?
940,daenerysI know.
941,"jonI'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
942,tyrionIt's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
943,jonWill you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
944,tyrionI expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
945,"jonIf you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
946,tyrionOf course.
947,jonHe'll never walk again.
948,"tyrionIf you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
949,"jonFarewell, My Lord."
950,"syrioYou are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
951,aryaWho are you?
952,"syrioYour dancing master, Syrio Forel."
953,"syrioTomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
954,aryaIt's too heavy.
955,syrioIt is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
956,aryaWhat if I drop it?
957,"syrioThe steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
958,aryaI'm a girl.
959,"syrioBoy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
960,aryaA needle.
961,"syrioAhhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
962,"syrioUp! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
963,oldThe little Lordo s been dreaming again.
964,theonWe have visitors.
965,branI don't want to see anyone.
966,"theonReally? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
967,branI don't want to go.
968,"theonNeither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
969,tyrionI must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
970,robbAny man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
971,"tyrionAny man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
972,"robbI'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
973,tyrionThen you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
974,tyrionSo it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
975,maesterHe has no memory of that day.
976,tyrionCurious.
977,robbWhy are you here?
978,tyrionWould your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
979,"branKneel, Hodor."
980,"tyrionDo you like to ride, Bran?"
981,"branYes. Well, I mean I did like to."
982,maesterThe boy has lost the use of his legs.
983,"tyrionWhat of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
984,branI'm not a cripple.
985,tyrionThen I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
986,branWill I really be able to ride?
987,tyrionYou will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
988,robbIs this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
989,"tyrionI have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
990,robbYou've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
991,"tyrionSpare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
992,"theonCouldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
993,"tyrionCome to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
994,theonHe's not my master.
995,"tyrionNo, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
996,theonShe wasn't feeling well.
997,"tyrionShe's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
998,theonMy lady's whereabouts...
999,"tyrionMy lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1000,theonMust have been a pretty sight.
1001,"tyrionNothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1002,theonWe were outnumbered 10 to one.
1003,"tyrionA stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1004,"theonCareful, Imp."
1005,"tyrionI've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1006,"jonLeg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1007,grennWhat in seven hells is that?
1008,pypThey'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1009,alliserTell them your name.
1010,"samSamwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1011,rastCome to take the black pudding.
1012,"alliserWell, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
1013,"samI yield. Please, no more."
1014,"alliserOn your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
1015,jonEnough! He yielded.
1016,"alliserLooks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
1017,jonAre you sure you want to do this?
1018,grennNo. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1019,alliserWe're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
1020,pypWell fought!
1021,grennPiss off.
1022,samDid he hurt you?
1023,jonI've had worse.
1024,samYou can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1025,"jonIt's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1026,grennWhy didn't you get up and fight?
1027,samI wanted to. I just couldn't.
1028,grennWhy not?
1029,samI'm a coward. My father always says so.
1030,jonThe Wall's no place for cowards.
1031,samYou're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1032,grennA bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1033,pypYou're too stupid to be a coward.
1034,grennYou're too stupid to be a...
1035,"pypQuick now, before summer's over."
1036,grennCome on here!
1037,jorahVaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1038,viserysA pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
1039,daenerysThese are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1040,"viserysI'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1041,"daenerysIf my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1042,jorahThe Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1043,daenerysBut if they did?
1044,"jorahKing Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1045,daenerysAnd you know these men?
1046,"jorahI fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1047,daenerysYou sold slaves.
1048,jorahAye.
1049,daenerysWhy?
1050,jorahI had no money and an expensive wife.
1051,daenerysAnd where is she now?
1052,"jorahIn another place, with another man."
1053,doreahYour Grace?
1054,"viserysYes, my dear?"
1055,doreahThey call you the last dragon...
1056,viserysThey do.
1057,doreahYou have dragon's blood in your veins?
1058,viserysIt's entirely possible.
1059,doreahWhat happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1060,"viserysThe brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1061,doreahI have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1062,viserysReally? Why dragons?
1063,"doreahThey can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1064,"viserysWell, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1065,doreahI was not locked in. I have seen things.
1066,viserysWhat have you seen?
1067,doreahI've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1068,viserysA pirate ship?
1069,doreahA dragon.
1070,"viserysNo, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
1071,doreahWhat happened to the skulls?
1072,"viserysI don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1073,doreahThat's very sad.
1074,"viserysYes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1075,"doreahNo, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1076,viserysTo teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1077,"septaSomeday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1078,sansaWhat if I have a girl?
1079,"septaGods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1080,sansaWhat if I only have girls?
1081,septaI wouldn't worry about that.
1082,"sansaJeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1083,"septaYes, but it's highly unlikely."
1084,sansaBut what if?
1085,"septaIf you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1086,sansaAnd everyone would hate me.
1087,septaNobody could ever hate you.
1088,sansaJoffrey does.
1089,septaNonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1090,sansaPlease shut up about it.
1091,septaDo you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1092,sansaAegon the Conqueror.
1093,septaAnd who built the Red Keep?
1094,sansaMaegor the Cruel.
1095,septaAnd how many years did it take to build...
1096,"sansaMy grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1097,"septaThey were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1098,sansaThe Mad King.
1099,septaCommonly known as the Mad King.
1100,sansaWhy were they killed?
1101,septaYou should speak to your father about these matters.
1102,"sansaI don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1103,septaYou will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1104,"sansaNo, I won't."
1105,"janosIt's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1106,eddardThe King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1107,"janosCall it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1108,varysDreadful.
1109,"renlyIf you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1110,janosI need more men.
1111,eddardYou'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1112,petyrI will?
1113,"eddardYou found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1114,"janosThank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1115,"eddardThe sooner this is over, the better."
1116,"varysThe realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1117,petyrAnd every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1118,"eddardI'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1119,"grandThis heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1120,eddardI've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1121,"grandLord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1122,eddardWhy?
1123,grandI have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1124,eddardWhat did Jon want the night before he died?
1125,grandHe came inquiring after a book.
1126,eddardA book? What book?
1127,"grandI fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1128,eddardI'd like to read it.
1129,"grandThe lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
1130,"eddardHarkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1131,"grandAs I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1132,eddardDid Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1133,"grandHe did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1134,eddardJon's death...
1135,grandSuch a tragedy.
1136,eddardDid he say anything to you during his final hours?
1137,"grandNothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
1138,"eddardThe seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1139,"grandThe dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1140,eddardAnd you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1141,grandWhat else could it be?
1142,eddardPoison.
1143,grandA disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1144,eddardI've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1145,"grandYes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1146,eddardEverybody knows that.
1147,"grandYes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1148,eddardI've taken enough of your time.
1149,"grandNo trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1150,eddardThank you. I'll find my own way out.
1151,aryaSyrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1152,eddardIt's a hard fall down these steps.
1153,aryaSyrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1154,eddardCats? Syrio says…
1155,aryaHe says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1156,eddardHe's right about that.
1157,aryaNow that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1158,eddardHe needs to get his strength back first.
1159,"aryaHe wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1160,eddardNo. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1161,aryaCan I be Lord of a holdfast?
1162,eddardYou will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1163,aryaNo. That's not me.
1164,"samHello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1165,jonCome stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1166,"samNo, that's all right. I'm fine."
1167,jonYou're not. You're freezing.
1168,samI don't like high places.
1169,"jonYou can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1170,"samOn the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1171,"jonYes, he is."
1172,"samI'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1173,jonWell… You can't get any worse.
1174,petyrI hear you're reading a boring book.
1175,eddardPycelle talks too much.
1176,"petyrHe never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1177,eddardKnighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1178,petyrI promised Cat that I'd help you.
1179,eddardWhere is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1180,petyrA singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1181,eddardVarys or the Queen?
1182,petyrNo. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1183,eddardYes.
1184,"petyrThe wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1185,"petyrI have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1186,"eddardLord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1187,petyrDistrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1188,jorySer Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1189,"hughAs you can see, I'm busy."
1190,"joryI'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1191,"hughI'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1192,"joryNo ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1193,"hughI see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1194,"joryHe said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1195,eddardA knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1196,"joryYou shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1197,eddardLet them look.
1198,"tobhoThe former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1199,eddardWhat did Lord Arryn want?
1200,tobhoHe always came to see the boy.
1201,eddardI'd like to see him as well.
1202,"tobhoAs you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1203,eddardThis is fine work.
1204,gendryIt's not for sale.
1205,"tobhoBoy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1206,gendryI made it for me.
1207,"tobhoForgive him, my Lord."
1208,"eddardThere's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1209,"gendryHe just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1210,eddardWhat kind of questions?
1211,"gendryAbout my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1212,eddardYour mother?
1213,"gendryWho she was, what she looked like."
1214,eddardWhat did you tell him?
1215,gendryShe died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1216,"eddardLook at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1217,joryFind anything?
1218,eddardKing Robert's bastard son.
1219,joryThis is for the King from Lord Stark.
1220,jaimeListen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1221,joryThree? Four?
1222,jaimeHe likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1223,"joryForgive me, my Lord..."
1224,jaimeWhy do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1225,"joryWe've met before, you know."
1226,"jaimeHave we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1227,joryThe siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1228,jaimeThat's where you got your scar?
1229,joryAye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1230,jaimeVicious sons of whores.
1231,joryThey like their bloodshed.
1232,jaimeThey stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1233,joryWith his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1234,jaimeI saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1235,joryTheon? He's a good lad.
1236,jaimeI doubt it.
1237,robertI'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1238,joryCan I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1239,jaimeI don't serve Lord Stark.
1240,grennWhere have you been?
1241,jonWatch duty. With Sam.
1242,pypPrince Porkchop. Where is he?
1243,jonHe wasn't hungry.
1244,pypImpossible!
1245,"jonThat's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1246,"rastYou are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1247,jonNo one touches Sam.
1248,"alliserWhat are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
1249,"grennHit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1250,"alliserYou think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
1251,viserysYou send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1252,"doreahForgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1253,"daenerysHush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1254,"irriYes, Khaleesi."
1255,daenerysWhy did you hit her?!
1256,viserysHow many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1257,daenerysI wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1258,viserysWhat's this?
1259,daenerysIt's a gift. I had it made for you.
1260,viserysDothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1261,daenerysPlease.
1262,viserysThis stinks of manure. All of it.
1263,daenerysStop - stop it.
1264,"viserysYou would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1265,daenerysYou've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1266,viserysYou do not talk back to me!
1267,viserysYou are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1268,daenerysI am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1269,samI know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1270,jonI wouldn't doubt it.
1271,samDon't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1272,jonSally on the side?
1273,"samIt's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1274,jonI didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1275,samWhy not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1276,"jonAs a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1277,samI find that hard to believe.
1278,"jonI came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1279,samYou didn't know where to put it?
1280,jonI know where to put it.
1281,samWas she... Old and ugly?
1282,jonYoung and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1283,samWhat color hair?
1284,jonRed.
1285,samI like red hair. And her... Her...
1286,jonYou don't want to know.
1287,samThat good?
1288,jonBetter.
1289,samOh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1290,jonWhat's my name?
1291,samJon Snow?
1292,jonAnd why is my surname Snow?
1293,samBecause... You're a bastard from the north.
1294,"jonI never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1295,samSo... You didn't know where to put it?
1296,"alliserEnjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1297,samIt is a bit nippy.
1298,"alliserA bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1299,jonI build my own fires.
1300,"alliserThat's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1301,daenerysI hit him. I hit the dragon.
1302,jorahYour brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1303,daenerysHe is still the true King.
1304,jorahThe truth now
1305,daenerysNo. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1306,"jorahThe common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1307,"daenerysWhat do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1308,jorahHome.
1309,daenerysI pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1310,petyrLover's quarrel?
1311,sansaI'm sorry. Do I...?
1312,"septaSansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1313,petyrAn old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1314,aryaWhy do they call you Littlefinger?
1315,sansaArya!
1316,septaDon't be rude!
1317,"petyrNo, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1318,robertI've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1319,"sansaGods, who is that?"
1320,petyrSer Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
1321,sansaAnd his opponent?
1322,petyrSer Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1323,"robertYes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1324,"petyrNot what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1325,sansaI won't tell anyone. I promise.
1326,"petyrNo, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1327,"joryMy Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1328,eddardYour Grace.
1329,cerseiYou're missing your tournament.
1330,eddardPutting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1331,cerseiI thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1332,eddardShe likes it here.
1333,"cerseiThe only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1334,eddardWhat are you doing here?
1335,cerseiI might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1336,"eddardThe King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1337,"cerseiYou can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1338,"eddardIf that's my job, then so be it."
1339,"cerseiYou're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1340,"eddardI was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1341,cerseiAs was I.
1342,"marillionSeven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1343,catelynAnd to you.
1344,"rodrickBoy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1345,"marillionGood idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1346,rodrickI'd rather throw myself down a well.
1347,"marillionGrandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1348,"mashaI'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1349,"tyrionMy men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1350,"mashaTruly, my lord, we have nothing."
1351,tyrionIs there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1352,bronnYou can have my room.
1353,"tyrionThere's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1354,"yorenAye, my Lord."
1355,marillionMy Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1356,tyrionNothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1357,mashaLady Stark.
1358,"catelynI was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1359,"knightIt is, my Lady."
1360,catelynAnd is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1361,knightShe is.
1362,catelynThe red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1363,knightOur lord is honored by his trust.
1364,"tyrionI envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1365,catelynKnight of House Frey
1366,"catelynThis man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1367,eddardDoes Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
1368,barristanNo. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1369,eddardHe'd never worn this armor before.
1370,barristanBad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1371,eddardWho determines the draw?
1372,"barristanAll the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1373,"eddardAye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1374,barristanLife is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1375,"eddardI'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1376,barristanYou're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1377,eddardMy father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1378,"barristanHe was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1379,eddardAnd that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1380,barristanPerhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1381,eddardYes. That will never happen.
1382,barristanRobert tends to do what he wants.
1383,"eddardIf the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1384,"lancelIt's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1385,robertYour mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1386,eddardYou're too fat for your armor.
1387,"robertFat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1388,"robertOh, it's funny, is it?"
1389,"lancelNo, Your Grace."
1390,robertNo? You don't like the Hando s joke?
1391,eddardYou're torturing the poor boy.
1392,"robertYou heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1393,eddardThe breastplate stretcher?
1394,robertHow long before he figures it out?
1395,eddardMaybe you should have one invented.
1396,"robertAll right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1397,eddardYou have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1398,robertWhy? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1399,eddardAnd who's going to hit you back?
1400,robertAnybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1401,eddardThere's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1402,robertAre you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1403,eddardAye.
1404,robertDrink.
1405,eddardI'm not thirsty.
1406,robertDrink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1407,eddardYour squire... A Lannister boy?
1408,"robertHmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1409,eddardRobert?
1410,"robertWhat? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1411,eddardWhere's Arya
1412,sansaAt her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1413,"sansaThank you, Ser Loras."
1414,sansaDon't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1415,eddardHey.
1416,sansaI can't watch.
1417,petyr100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1418,renlyI'll take that bet.
1419,petyrNow what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1420,renlyOr you could even buy a friend.
1421,sansaHe's going to die.
1422,eddardSer Loras rides well.
1423,"renlySuch a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1424,"petyrAnd tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
1425,"petyrLoras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
1426,sansaSer Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
1427,petyrNo honor but quite a bit of gold.
1428,robertStop this madness in the name of your King!
1429,"lorasI owe you my life, Ser."
1430,sandorI'm no Ser.
1431,catelynRemove his hood.
1432,"marillionOn that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold."
1433,tyrionThis isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
1434,catelynI did... often and loudly.
1435,"tyrionVery wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
1436,catelynAnd why would I do that?
1437,tyrionWhy not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
1438,catelynShadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
1439,"tyrionAh... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
1440,catelynFive years ago.
1441,"tyrionShe's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
1442,"catelynI am not a murderer, Lannister."
1443,tyrionNeither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
1444,catelynThe dagger found
1445,tyrionWhat sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
1446,rodrikShould I gag him?
1447,tyrionWhy? Am I starting to make sense?
1448,"rodrikMy Lady, this way."
1449,"tyrionUntie me. If I die, what's the point?"
1450,catelynRodrik?
1451,"rodrikI'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
1452,bronnYour first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
1453,"tyrionWell, I'm willing if she is."
1454,maesterBran...
1455,"branThe Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow""."
1456,maesterLords?
1457,branThe Greyjoys.
1458,"theonFamed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
1459,maesterAnd failed rebellions.
1460,branSigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
1461,maesterGood.

1463,branThe Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
1464,maesterHmm...
1465,"branWords - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."""
1466,"maesterNo. A common saying, but not their official motto."
1467,branLords - the Lannisters.
1468,maesterWe're still on their words.
1469,branI don't know them.
1470,maesterYou do know them. Think.
1471,"branUnbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
1472,maesterThat's House Martell.
1473,"branRighteous in wrath""."
1474,maesterHouse Hornwood.
1475,"branFamily, duty, honor""."
1476,maesterThose are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
1477,"branFamily, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
1478,maesterYou know it is.
1479,branFamily comes first?
1480,maesterYour mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
1481,"branHow can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
1482,maesterYour mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
1483,branAnd then she left!
1484,"maesterWhen you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
1485,branWhy did she leave?
1486,"maesterI still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
1487,branDo you know where she is now? Today?
1488,"maesterNo, I don't."
1489,branThen how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
1490,maesterSometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
1491,branI'll never shoot another arrow.
1492,maesterAnd where is that written?
1493,branYou need legs to work a bow.
1494,"maesterHmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1495,branReally?
1496,maesterDothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1497,theonShh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1498,rosI thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1499,theonImportant enough for the likes of you.
1500,"rosYou're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1501,theonWho? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1502,rosJealous?
1503,theonWhy should I be jealous?
1504,theonAnyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1505,rosMight surprise you.
1506,theonHmm?
1507,rosHe's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1508,theonGenerous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1509,rosYou are jealous.
1510,"theonI'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1511,rosAnd what about the Starks?
1512,theonI've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
1513,"rosA “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
1514,theonMy father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1515,rosYou're a very serious boy.
1516,theonI'm not a boy.
1517,"rosOh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1518,theonI don't want to pay for it.
1519,rosThen get yourself a wife.
1520,aryaCome on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1521,"varysHow is your son, my Lord?"
1522,eddardHe'll never walk again.
1523,varysBut his mind is sound?
1524,eddardSo they say.
1525,varysA blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1526,"varysIf the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1527,eddardI've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1528,varysI didn't trust you.
1529,eddardSo why do you trust me now?
1530,"varysThe Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1531,eddardWhat sort of doom does the King face?
1532,"varysThe same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1533,eddardWho gave it to him?
1534,"varysSome dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1535,"eddardThe squire, Ser Hugh?"
1536,"varysPity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1537,"eddardIf Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1538,varysSomeone who could afford it.
1539,eddardJon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1540,varysHe started asking questions.
1541,varysHe's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1542,"illyrioAnd when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1543,"varysThe gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1544,"illyrioWhat good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1545,varysThis Hand is not the other.
1546,illyrioWe need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1547,"varysDelay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1548,illyrioIt never was.
1549,varysThe first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1550,petyrYou do move quietly.
1551,varysWe all have our qualities.
1552,petyrYou look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1553,varysI think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1554,"petyrAm I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1555,"varysOh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1556,"petyrI'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1557,"varysThough I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1558,petyrAll desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1559,varysAnd I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1560,"petyrStrictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1561,varysStrictly speaking.
1562,"petyrTell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1563,"varysDo you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1564,petyrSince you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1565,"varysNow the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1566,petyrSaw me with your own eyes?
1567,varysEyes I own.
1568,petyrCouncil business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1569,varysEveryone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1570,petyrOne shudders at the thought.
1571,varysOh.
1572,petyrBut you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1573,varysHave you?
1574,"petyrYes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1575,varysWas that you under the bed?
1576,"petyrAnd not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1577,"varysOh, please."
1578,petyrTo find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1579,"renlyWhat are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1580,petyrTo a small council meeting?
1581,varysDisturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1582,guardOff with you. No begging.
1583,aryaI'm not a beggar. I live here.
1584,guardD'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1585,aryaI want to see my father.
1586,"guardI want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1587,"guardYou want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1588,"aryaMy father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1589,eddardYou know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1590,aryaThey said they were going to kill you.
1591,eddardWho did?
1592,"aryaI didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1593,"eddardOh, Arya."
1594,aryaI'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1595,eddardWhere did you hear this?
1596,"aryaIn the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1597,eddardWhat were you doing in the dungeons?
1598,aryaChasing a cat.
1599,"joryPardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1600,"eddardYour name, friend?"
1601,"yorenYoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1602,aryaI'm a girl!
1603,eddardDid Benjen send you?
1604,"yorenNo one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1605,"eddardAh, we'll find recruits for you."
1606,"yorenThank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1607,eddardKnow what?
1608,"yorenBest said in private, my Lord."
1609,eddardGo on. We'll talk more later.
1610,"eddardJory, take her safely to her room."
1611,"joryCome along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1612,aryaHow many guards does my father have?
1613,joryHere in King's Landing? Fifty.
1614,"aryaYou wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1615,"joryNo fear on that count, little Lady."
1616,eddardWell?
1617,"yorenIt's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1618,"vardisYou're far from home, Lady Stark."
1619,catelynTo whom do I speak?
1620,"vardisSer Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1621,catelynThere was no time to send word.
1622,"vardisMay I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1623,catelynThat's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1624,vardisHe doesn't look like a prisoner.
1625,catelynMy sister will decide what he looks like.
1626,"vardisYes, my Lady. She will at that."
1627,tyrionThe Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1628,bronnGive me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1629,tyrionI like you.
1630,"stewardLord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1631,eddardI need to see the King first -- alone.
1632,"stewardThe King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1633,eddardIs it about my wife?
1634,"stewardNo, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1635,robertThe whore is pregnant.
1636,eddardYou're speaking of murdering a child.
1637,"robertI warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1638,eddardYou will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1639,"robertHonor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1640,eddardThen we're no better than the Mad King.
1641,"robertCareful, Ned. Careful now."
1642,eddardYou want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1643,"varysNo rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1644,eddardBased on whose information?
1645,varysSer Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1646,eddardMormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1647,"petyrJorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1648,"eddardHe broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1649,robertAnd if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
1650,eddardThe Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1651,robertDo nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1652,"varysI understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1653,"grandI bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1654,renlyWe should have had them both killed years ago.
1655,"petyrWhen you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1656,"eddardI followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1657,robertShe dies.
1658,eddardI will have no part in it.
1659,"robertYou're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1660,eddardAnd good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1661,"robertOut! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1662,eddardI'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1663,"joryRight away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1664,"petyrHis Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1665,eddardWhat can I do for you?
1666,petyrWhen do you return to Winterfell?
1667,eddardWhy? What do you care?
1668,"petyrIf you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1669,eddardI don't have the time.
1670,petyrIt won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1671,eddardRound up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1672,joryHeward and Wyl.
1673,eddardFind them and meet me at the stables.
1674,"lysaYou bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1675,"catelynLysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1676,lysaTo stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1677,robinMommy? Is that the bad man?
1678,lysaIt is.
1679,robinHe's little.
1680,lysaHe's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1681,tyrionOh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1682,lysaYou will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1683,"tyrionIf any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1684,"robinYou can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1685,"lysaShh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1686,robinMommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1687,"lysaPerhaps you will, my little love."
1688,catelynThis man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1689,"lysaSer Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1690,"mordYou go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1691,lorasLord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1692,"renlyRobert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1693,lorasYou're jealous.
1694,renlyAre you sure this won't hurt?
1695,lorasOnly if I slip.
1696,renlyAnd you prefer me like this?
1697,lorasMhmm.
1698,"renlyIf you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1699,lorasI want you.
1700,"renlyMy brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1701,lorasHold still.
1702,"renlyAll I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1703,lorasYou did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
1704,renlyHis eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1705,lorasHe shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
1706,renlyEasy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1707,lorasIt's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1708,"renlyI could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1709,"lorasYes well, I guess we'll never know."
1710,renlyEverywhere?
1711,lorasEverywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1712,"renlyIt needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1713,lorasIt's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1714,"renlyHe does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1715,lorasI have an outrageous amount of money.
1716,renlyNot as much as the Lannisters.
1717,lorasBut a lot more than you.
1718,"renlyRobert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1719,lorasHmm... How did that ever happen?
1720,renlyBecause he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1721,lorasDo you know who should be King?
1722,renlyBe serious.
1723,"lorasI am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1724,renlyI'm fourth in line.
1725,lorasAnd where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1726,renlyStannis?
1727,lorasStannis has the personality of a lobster.
1728,renlyHe's still my older brother.
1729,renlyWhat are you doing?!
1730,lorasLook at it.
1731,renlyYou cut me!
1732,"lorasIt's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1733,"lorasYou're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1734,cerseiI'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1735,robertI'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1736,"cerseiWithout a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1737,robertI suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1738,cerseiNo. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1739,"robertI don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1740,cerseiThe Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1741,"robertIt's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1742,cerseiIs my father wrong?
1743,"robertLet's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1744,cerseiWe still outnumber them.
1745,robertWhich is the bigger number -- five or one?
1746,cerseiFive.
1747,"robertFive... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1748,cerseiWhat do you want?
1749,"robertWe haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1750,cerseiOur marriage.
1751,"robertAh, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1752,cerseiEvery day.
1753,robertHow long can hate hold a thing together?
1754,"cerseiWell, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1755,"robertYes, it is."
1756,"cerseiYes, it tis. What was she like?"
1757,"robertYou've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1758,"cerseiAt first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1759,robertSo why now?
1760,cerseiWhat harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1761,"robertYou want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1762,"cerseiI felt something for you once, you know?"
1763,robertI know.
1764,"cerseiEven after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1765,robertNo. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1766,cerseiIt doesn't make me feel anything.
1767,"mhaegenShe looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1768,"mhaegenTell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1769,eddardI will.
1770,"mhaegenAnd tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1771,"eddardWhen Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1772,"mhaegenHe wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1773,eddardShe looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1774,"petyrBrothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1775,eddardWhat do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1776,"petyrWell, he has more than you, for a start."
1777,eddardHow many?
1778,"petyrDoes it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1779,eddardAnd Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1780,petyrHe was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1781,eddardCome.
1782,eddardJory!
1783,joryMy Lord.
1784,jaimeSuch a small pack of wolves.
1785,"joryStay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1786,jaimeWas!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1787,"petyrWhat's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1788,"jaimeGet back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1789,eddardI remember him well.
1790,"jaimeIt seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1791,eddardHe was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1792,petyrMy Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1793,"jaimeCome, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1794,joryIf you threaten my Lord again...
1795,"jaimeThreaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
1796,"eddardYou kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1797,jaimeYou're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1798,"jaimeMy brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1799,"eddardYour pardon, your Grace."
1800,cerseiDo you know what your wife has done?
1801,eddardShe did nothing I did not command.
1802,robertWho'd have thought she had it in her?
1803,cerseiBy what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1804,eddardI am the King's Hand -
1805,cerseiYou were the King's Hand!
1806,eddardtrying to keep the peace -
1807,cerseiYou shall now be held accountable.
1808,"robertOh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
1809,eddardHe butchered my men.
1810,cerseiLord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
1811,"robertQuiet, woman."
1812,eddardJaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
1813,cerseiI took you for a king.
1814,robertHold your tongue.
1815,cerseiHe's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
1816,cerseiI shall wear this like a badge of honor.
1817,robertWear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
1818,robertSee what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
1819,eddardIf we don't act… there will be a war.
1820,"robertSo tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
1821,eddardAnd what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
1822,"robertI'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"
1823,"eddardAs you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
1824,"robertPiss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."
1825,eddardThe hunt?
1826,robertKilling things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
1827,eddardThe Targaryen girl -
1828,"robertSeven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."
1829,irriKhaleesi?
1830,"irriOh, Khaleesi!"
1831,daenerysYou're hurt.
1832,robbNot too fast.
1833,"branCome on, Dancer."
1834,theonWhen are you gonna tell him?
1835,robbNot now.
1836,theonBlood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
1837,robbYou're talking about war.
1838,theonI'm talking about justice.
1839,robbOnly the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
1840,theonA Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
1841,robbYou want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
1842,theonYou're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
1843,"robbAnd it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
1844,robbWhere's Bran?
1845,theonI don't know. It's not my House.
1846,branRobb?
1847,oshaAll alone in the deep dark woods.
1848,"branI'm not alone, my brother is with me."
1849,wildlingI don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
1850,"oshaOh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
1851,wildlingWe'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
1852,"branI can't. The saddle, the straps."
1853,wildlingWhat's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
1854,"branI'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
1855,wildlingCut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
1856,oshathe boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
1857,wildlingPiss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
1858,robbDrop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
1859,branRobb!
1860,wildlingShut up! Drop the blade!
1861,"branNo, don't."
1862,wildlingDo it.
1863,robbAre you all right?
1864,"branYes, it doesn't hurt."
1865,"theonTough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
1866,robbHave you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
1867,theonHe would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
1868,robbYou don't have the right -
1869,"theonTo what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
1870,robbWhat about her?
1871,"oshaGive me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
1872,robbWe'll keep her alive.
1873,tyrionMord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
1874,mordDwarf man making noise!
1875,tyrionHow would you like to be rich?
1876,mordDwarf man still making noise.
1877,"tyrionMy family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
1878,mordNo gold!
1879,"tyrionWell, I don't have it here."
1880,mordNo gold! Fuck off.
1881,aryaI don't want to practice today.
1882,syrioNo?
1883,aryaThey killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
1884,syrioYou are troubled.
1885,aryaYes -
1886,"syrioGood! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
1887,aryaI don't like dolls and k -
1888,syrioYou're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
1889,"syrioMore trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
1890,syrioThe old and the new.
1891,syrioThere is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
1892,viserysShe has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
1893,jorahShe's doing well.
1894,viserysShe'll never keep it down.
1895,viserysTell me what she is saying.
1896,jorahThe prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
1897,jorahShe's going to have a boy.
1898,viserysHe won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
1899,"jorahThe stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
1900,daenerysA prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
1901,viserysThey love her.
1902,jorahShe truly is a queen today.
1903,jorahDon't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
1904,viserysIt's not my law.
1905,jorahThey don't belong to you.
1906,viserysWhatever is hers is also mine.
1907,"jorahOnce, perhaps."
1908,"viserysIf I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
1909,jorahAnd you have all three.
1910,"viserysI need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
1911,"jorahYou can go, but you can't have the eggs."
1912,viserysYou swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
1913,jorahIt means everything to me.
1914,viserysAnd yet here you stand?
1915,jorahAnd here I stand.
1916,tyrionMord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
1917,mordNoise again!
1918,tyrionAbout the gold -
1919,"tyrionListen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
1920,mordWhere?
1921,"tyrionWhere? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
1922,mordYou want free? Go be free.
1923,"tyrionHave you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
1924,mordWhat message?
1925,tyrionTell her I wish to confess my crimes.
1926,lysaYou wish to confess your crimes?
1927,"tyrionYes, my lady. I do, my lady."
1928,"lysaSkycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
1929,"tyrionWhere do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
1930,lysaSilence!
1931,robinWhat happened next?!
1932,lysaWhat do you think you're doing?
1933,tyrionConfessing my crimes.
1934,"catelynLord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
1935,"tyrionOh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
1936,"lysaYou've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
1937,"tyrionIs this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
1938,"lysaIf you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
1939,tyrionI understand the law.
1940,lysaWe have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
1941,"lysaYou want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
1942,tyrionNo need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
1943,lysaYou have that right.
1944,"knightMy lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
1945,knightThe honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
1946,"knightI'll fight for you, my Lady."
1947,knightIt'll be my honor.
1948,knightThe honor should be mine.
1949,robinMake the bad man fly!
1950,lysaSer Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
1951,"serWith all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
1952,tyrionAgreed.
1953,lysaYou demanded a trial by combat.
1954,"tyrionNow I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
1955,"serMy Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you."
1956,"tyrionI wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
1957,lysaThe Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
1958,"tyrionSend a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
1959,lysaThe trial will be today.
1960,tyrionDo I have a volunteer?
1961,tyrionAnyone?... Anyone?
1962,lysaI think that we can assume that no one is willing -
1963,bronnI'll stand for the dwarf.
1964,"lancelMore wine, your Grace?"
1965,"robertOh, what was I saying?"
1966,renlyA simpler time.
1967,"robertIt was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
1968,"barristonIt was, your Grace."
1969,"robertThe enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
1970,renlySounds exhilarating.
1971,"robertExhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
1972,"renlyOnce, I think."
1973,"robertYou think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
1974,renlyThose were some lucky girls.
1975,"robertYou ever make the eight, Barristan?"
1976,"barristanI don't believe so, your Grace."
1977,robertThose were the days!
1978,"renlyWhat days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1979,"robertEasy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
1980,renlyI suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
1981,"manThey burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
1982,"grandBrigands, most likely."
1983,"manThey weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."
1984,"grandIt's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting."
1985,petyrFish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
1986,"eddardThese men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
1987,"manNone, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
1988,petyrThat sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
1989,eddardYou're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1990,grandWhy should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
1991,petyrI've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
1992,"grandIf the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
1993,petyrIt would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
1994,grandWel…
1995,"eddardI cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
1996,eddardYou shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
1997,bericAs you command.
1998,"eddardIn the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
1999,grandMy lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
2000,eddardGrand Maester Pycelle.
2001,grandMy Lord.
2002,"eddardSend a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2003,"petyrA bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2004,eddardThen how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2005,robinIs it over?
2006,lysaYou don't fight with honor!
2007,bronnNo. He did.
2008,robinCan I make the little man fly now?
2009,tyrionNot this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2010,tyrionA Lannister always pays his debts.
2011,mordaneYou wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2012,"sansaWell, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
2013,mordaneIt's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2014,sansaMy mother isn't from the North.
2015,mordaneI'm aware of that.
2016,sansaWhy do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2017,mordaneYes. I have hair.
2018,sansaI've never seen it.
2019,mordaneWould you like to?
2020,"sansaNo. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2021,mordaneI come from a very small village in -
2022,"sansaOh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
2023,mordaneSansa -
2024,sansaSepta.
2025,mordaneNow you are being rude.
2026,mordaneMy prince.
2027,sansaMy prince.
2028,joffreyMy lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2029,sansaIt's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2030,"joffreyYou'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2031,sansaThere's nothing to forgive.
2032,"joffreyYou're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2033,theonStop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2034,rosGoing to King's Landing.
2035,theonIn a turnip cart?
2036,rosI'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2037,theonAnd you can afford that?
2038,rosSome of my friends are more generous than others.
2039,theonThere's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
2040,rosI'll have lots of company…
2041,"theonYes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2042,"rosAnd what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2043,theonDon't be a fool.
2044,"rosI hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon."
2045,theonLet me see it one more time?
2046,rosSee what?
2047,theonI'm going to miss you!
2048,rosI know.
2049,eddardI'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
2050,sansaWhat?!
2051,eddardListen -
2052,sansaWhat about Joffrey?
2053,aryaAre you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
2054,eddardWhat? No.
2055,"sansaPlease, Father. Please don't."
2056,aryaYou can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
2057,eddardThis isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2058,aryaCan't we take Syrio back with us?
2059,sansaWho cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2060,aryaSeven hells.
2061,"eddardWhen you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -"
2062,"sansaI don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2063,"aryaThe lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
2064,sansaHe is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
2065,"eddardGo on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2066,sansaWait!
2067,aryaCome on!
2068,sansaIt's not fair!
2069,"eddardLord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”"
2070,viserysDaenerys! Where's my sister?
2071,daenerysStop him.
2072,viserysWhere is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.
2073,jorahCome.
2074,viserysGet your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
2075,viserysKhal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
2076,jorahKhal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2077,viserysThat is no place for a king.
2078,khalYou are no king.
2079,viserysKeep away from me!
2080,"daenerysViserys, please."
2081,viserysThere she is.
2082,jorahPut the sword down. They'll kill us all.
2083,viserysThey can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
2084,viserysTell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
2085,viserysWhat's he saying?
2086,"daenerysHe says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2087,viserysThat was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2088,viserysNo! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2089,jorahLook away Khaleesi.
2090,daenerysNo.
2091,"viserysNo. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!"
2092,viserysDany please!
2093,khalA crown for a king.
2094,jorahKhaleesi…
2095,daenerysHe was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2096,"jaimeSummoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
2097,tywinAttacking him was stupid.
2098,tywinLannisters don't act like fools.
2099,jaimeCatelyn Stark took my brother.
2100,tywinWhy is he still alive?
2101,jaimeTyrion?
2102,tywinNed Stark.
2103,"jaimeOne of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
2104,jaimeIt wouldn't have been clean.
2105,tywinClean...
2106,tywinYou spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2107,jaimeI could care less what anyone thinks of me.
2108,tywinNow that's what you want people to think of you.
2109,jaimeIt's the truth.
2110,"tywinWhen you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
2111,jaimeOf course it bothers me.
2112,tywinThe lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2113,jaimeI didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2114,"tywinHe's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
2115,jaimeSo the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
2116,"tywinNo, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2117,tywinHmm.
2118,cerseiYou're in pain.
2119,"eddardI've had worse, my lady."
2120,cerseiPerhaps it's time to go home.
2121,eddardThe South doesn't seem to agree with you.
2122,eddardI know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
2123,"cerseiDo you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2124,eddardHas he done this before?
2125,cerseiJaime would have killed him.
2126,cerseiMy brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2127,eddardYour brother Or your lover?
2128,cerseiThe Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2129,cerseiJaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2130,eddardMy son saw you with him.
2131,cerseiDo you love your children?
2132,eddardWith all my heart.
2133,cerseiNo more than I love mine.
2134,eddardAnd they are all Jaime's.
2135,cerseiThank the Gods.
2136,eddardYou've always hated him.
2137,cerseiHated him? I worshiped him.
2138,"eddardWhen the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
2139,"cerseiAnd what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2140,"eddardI've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2141,"cerseiOh, but it was."
2142,rosCome here.
2143,"petyrNo no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2144,"rosYes, My Lord."
2145,"petyrLet's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2146,"rosWhy don't you join us, My Lord?"
2147,petyrI'm saving myself for another.
2148,rosWhat she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2149,petyrA stupid saying.
2150,rosShe must be very beautiful.
2151,"petyrNo, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2152,rosI do believe my lordo s in love.
2153,petyrFor many years. Most of my life really.
2154,rosIs she still married to him?
2155,petyrOh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2156,rosAnd what do you want?
2157,"petyrOh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2158,theonYou're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
2159,oshaWhere is it you come from?
2160,theonThe Iron Islands.
2161,oshaThey far away?
2162,theonYou've never heard of the Iron Islands?
2163,"oshaTrust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2164,"theonTrust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2165,oshaAnd what's that?
2166,theonLord.
2167,oshaWhy?
2168,"theonWhy? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2169,"oshaWhat's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2170,theonI will be lord after my father.
2171,oshaSo you're not lord now?
2172,"theonNo, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
2173,oshaI just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2174,theonI'm not a Southerner.
2175,oshaYou're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2176,"theonYou're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2177,"oshaCouldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2178,theonImpudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2179,maesterTheon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2180,theonI thought she was our prisoner.
2181,maesterAre the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2182,maesterChances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2183,oshaI'm used to worse than him.
2184,oshaI'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2185,maesterWhy did you come here?
2186,oshaDidn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2187,maesterWhy? What are you afraid of?
2188,oshaThere's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2189,maesterOwls and Shadowcats and...

2215,"barristanHis squire, from the king's own skin."
2216,eddardHis squire? The Lannister boy?
2217,lordSuch a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
2218,eddardHis Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

2232,"daenerysMy brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
2233,"jorahForgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2234,daenerysAnd because he had dragons.
2235,"jorahAh well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2236,daenerysYou don't believe it.

2300,eddardWhat about Stannis?
2301,renlySaving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2302,eddardStannis is your older brother.
2303,renlyThis isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2304,eddardStannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2305,"renlyYes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2306,tellDo you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2307,eddardI will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.

2313,petyrSo when the King dies...
2314,eddardThe throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2315,petyrSo it would seem. Unless...
2316,"eddardThere is no ""unless""."
2317,petyrAnd he cannot take the throne without your help.
2318,eddardDo you have a shred of honor?
2319,petyrYou are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2320,eddardWe?
2321,"petyrYou'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2322,eddardWhat you suggest is treason.
2323,petyrOnly if we lose.
2324,"eddardMake peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.."
2325,eddardNo. I won't do it.
2326,petyrSo it will be Stannis and war?
2327,eddardThere is no other choice. He is the heir.
2328,"petyrSo why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2329,eddardYou promised Catelyn you would help me.
2330,petyrLook at you. You know what you want me to do.

2549,eddardOn her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
2550,"varysYou do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2551,eddardl don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
2552,"varysWhen l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2553,eddardHuh. Can you free me from this pit?
2554,"varysl could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2555,"eddardWhat do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
2556,varysPeace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2557,eddardRobb? He's just a boy.
2558,varysBoys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2559,eddardStannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2560,varysSansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2561,"eddardYou want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2562,"varysl want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2563,eddardYou think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2564,"varysPity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2565,robblt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2566,theonOr so Walder Frey would have you think.
2567,catelynKeep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.

2569,greatjonExpect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2570,robbFather rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2571,theonJust march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2572,greatjonNot in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2573,"catelynThe Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2574,robbHave my horse saddled and ready.
2575,greatjonEnter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.

2578,catelynl agree. l'll go.
2579,everyoneYou can't!
2580,catelynl have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2581,greatjonUnless there was a profit in it.
2582,walderWhat do you want?
2583,"catelynlt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2584,"walderOh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2585,"stevronFather, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2586,"walderWho asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2587,"rygerFather, please –"
2588,"walderl need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2589,catelynls there somewhere we can talk?
2590,walderWe're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2591,catelynl'm sure she will give you many sons.
2592,walderHuh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2593,"catelynHe is quite ill, my lord."
2594,"walderHuh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2595,"catelynMy lord, l –"
2596,walderDon't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2597,catelynl'm sure there were reasons –
2598,walderl didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2599,"catelynTo ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2600,walderWhy should l let him?
2601,"catelynlf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2602,"walderThere will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2603,catelynYou swore an oath to my father.
2604,"walderOh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2605,catelynWhy don't you?
2606,"walderStark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2607,voicesAnd engage!
2608,jeorWhen does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2609,"jonSoon, he says."
2610,"jeorGood. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2611,jonThis is Valyrian steel.
2612,"jeorlt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2613,"jonMy lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2614,"jeorOh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2615,"jonYes, my lord."
2616,"jeorRight. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2617,jonl'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2618,"jeorNo, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2619,unidentifiedWell done. Well done.
2620,"nightsYou earned that, Snow."
2621,nightsWell done.
2622,"pypGo on, let's have a look."
2623,jonAt what?
2624,grennThe sword! Show us the sword.
2625,allSword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2626,pypLet's have a look.
2627,grennPiss off.
2628,"pypCome on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2629,grennLook at its eyes.
2630,jonWhat is it?
2631,saml - l can't.
2632,jonYou can't what?
2633,saml'm really not supposed to say.
2634,jonAnd yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2635,samThere was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2636,jonWhat? What about him?
2637,"samHe's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2638,jonl should be there. l should be with him.
2639,"greatjonlf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2640,robbWell? What did he say?
2641,"catelynLord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2642,robbHuh.
2643,catelynLess the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2644,robbWhat does he want in return?
2645,catelynYou will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2646,"robbFine, fine. And?"
2647,catelynAnd Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2648,robbShe won't be happy about that. And?
2649,catelynAnd when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2650,robbl see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2651,catelynl did.
2652,robbAnd?
2653,catelynOne was – Do you consent?
2654,robbCan l refuse?
2655,catelynNot if you want to cross.
2656,robbThen l consent.
2657,jonSam said you wanted to see me?
2658,"maesterl did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2659,jonNo.
2660,"maesterSo they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2661,"jonHe would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2662,"maesterThen Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2663,jonSam told you.
2664,"maesterWe're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2665,jonAnd this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2666,"maesterOh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2667,"jonYou do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2668,maesterThe gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2669,jonWho are you?
2670,"maesterMy father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2671,jonYou're Aemon Targaryen.
2672,"maesterl'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2673,daenerysMy lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2674,khalMy horse…
2675,coholloBlood of my blood…
2676,"khalNo, l must ride."
2677,qothoHe fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2678,"daenerysHe's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2679,qothoThis is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2680,daenerysWe'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2681,"qothoYou do not command me, Khaleesi."
2682,daenerysFind Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2683,"qothoThe witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2684,daenerysBring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2685,qothoHyah! Hyah!
2686,kevanOur scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2687,"tywinThe boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2688,"tyrionOh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2689,"tywinl do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2690,"kevanThe great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2691,tyrionShagga likes axes.
2692,"tywinWhen the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2693,tyrionThe vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2694,kevanThey do seem rather ferocious.
2695,"tyrionFerocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2696,"tywinWhen soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2697,tyrionSurely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2698,tywinThere'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2699,"tyrionlt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2700,tyrionWhere did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2701,bronnl took her.
2702,tyrionTook her? From whom?
2703,"bronnFrom, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2704,tyrionAnd he didn't have anything to say about it?
2705,bronnHe said something.
2706,"tyrionWell, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2707,"bronnOh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2708,tyrionWho are you?
2709,prostituteWho would you like me to be?
2710,tyrionWhat did your mother call you?
2711,prostituteShae. What did your mother call you?
2712,tyrionMy mother died giving birth to me.
2713,shaels that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2714,tyrionWhat sort of accent is that?
2715,shaeForeign.
2716,tyrionFor-
2717,shaeWhat do you want from me?
2718,"tyrionWhat do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2719,shaeAnd what do l get?
2720,"tyrionOne - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2721,shaeWho told you this? Women you paid?
2722,tyrionAnd three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2723,shaeLet's start with your last night in this world.
2724,jorahKhaleesi.
2725,daenerysCome. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2726,"jorahHe will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2727,daenerysHe can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2728,jorahEven a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2729,daenerysl won't leave him.
2730,"jorahHe's already gone, Khaleesi."
2731,"daenerysEven if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2732,"jorahThis isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2733,mirriThe wound has festered.
2734,"qothoYou did this, witch."
2735,daenerysStop it! l don't want her hurt.
2736,"qothoNo? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2737,jorahRein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2738,"qothoOnly while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2739,daenerysl have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2740,"qothoThe dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2741,"daenerysl think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2742,jorahl think you're right.
2743,mirriYou've saved me once more.
2744,daenerysAnd now you must save him.
2745,mirriHe's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2746,daenerysSave him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2747,mirriThere is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2748,daenerysDo it. Save him.
2749,mirriThere is a price.
2750,"daenerysYou'll have gold, whatever you want."
2751,mirrilt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2752,daenerysMy death?
2753,"mirriNo, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2754,"rakharoKhaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2755,daenerysKill her and you kill your khal.
2756,rakharoThis is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2757,daenerysl am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2758,mirriGo. Now.
2759,daenerysTake her and leave. Take her!
2760,"mirriYou must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2761,daenerysNo one will enter.
2762,daenerysBring him back to me.
2763,daenerysl have to save him.
2764,qothoThis must not be.
2765,daenerysThis must be.
2766,qothoWitch.
2767,rakharoNothing good will come of this.
2768,"daenerysNo, you can't."
2769,irriKhaleesi!
2770,"jorahNo further, horselord."
2771,jorahAre you hurt?
2772,daenerysThe baby –
2773,jorahHmm?
2774,daenerysis coming.
2775,jorahFetch the midwives.
2776,rakharoThey will not come. They say she is cursed.
2777,jorahThey'll come or l'll have their heads.
2778,rakharoThe witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2779,"shaeAre you in agony, my lion?"
2780,tyrionNo.
2781,shaeYou look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2782,"tyrionAh! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2783,shaeJust used to it.
2784,bronnDrink.
2785,tyrionLet's play a new game.
2786,bronnThere's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2787,tyrionDoes it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2788,bronnNot if you win.
2789,"tyrionNo! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2790,shaeWhat are you good at?
2791,tyrionl happen to be a great judge of character.
2792,bronnThis sounds like a boring game.
2793,"tyrionlt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2794,shael don't want to play this game.
2795,tyrionFine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2796,bronnBut my mother hit harder.
2797,tyrionYou killed your first man before you were 12.
2798,bronnlt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2799,tyrionYou've been north of the Wall.
2800,shaeWhat brought you up there?
2801,bronnWork.
2802,"tyrionAnd you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2803,shael don't want to play.
2804,tyrionlt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2805,shaeDrink.
2806,"tyrionAll right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2807,tyrionAnd we've established the rules about lying?
2808,shaeDrink!
2809,tyrionYou wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2810,bronnThe whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2811,"tyrionSo, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2812,tyrionAre you sure –
2813,"shaeDrink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2814,"tyrionMy dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2815,shaeMy turn.
2816,"tyrionFine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2817,shaeWho were you in love with?
2818,tyrionThat's not how the game works.
2819,shael don't care the way the game works.
2820,bronnOur lord here used to be married.
2821,shaeMarried?
2822,tyrionHow did you hear that?
2823,bronnYou hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2824,"tyrionAnother night, perhaps."
2825,shaeNot another night. This night.
2826,tyrionlt's not a pleasant story.
2827,"shaeOh, maybe l will cry."
2828,bronnl'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2829,"tyrionSo l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2830,"bronnFor three chickens, l should hope so."
2831,"tyrionlt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2832,"bronnWell, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2833,"tyrionNot quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2834,bronnl would have killed the man who did that to me.
2835,shaeYou should have known she was a whore.
2836,"tyrionReally? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2837,shaeA girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2838,"tyrionAs l said, l was young and stupid."
2839,shaeYou are still young and stupid.
2840,tyrionWhat is it? What do you want?
2841,bronnYou're sleeping through the war.
2842,tyrionWhat?
2843,bronnThey stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2844,tyrionGet my squire!
2845,bronnYou don't have a squire.
2846,"tyrionlf l die, weep for me."
2847,shaeYou'll be dead. How will you know?
2848,tyrionl'll know.
2849,lannisterWatch out! Move!
2850,lannisterOut of the way! Move aside!
2851,bronnStay low.
2852,tyrionStay low?
2853,"bronnlf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2854,"tyrionl was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2855,tribesmenHalf man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
2856,tyrionTo battle!
2857,bronnYou're a shit warrior.
2858,tyrionl'm alive?
2859,bronnYou're alive.
2860,tyrionDid we win?
2861,bronnWe wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2862,tyrionHow did our tribesmen do?
2863,"bronnYeah, good."
2864,tyrionlt's nice to see them getting along.
2865,tywinYou're wounded.
2866,tyrionGood of you to notice. l hear we won.
2867,"tywinHuh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2868,"tyrionDid we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2869,tywinHe wasn't here.
2870,tyrionWhere was he?
2871,"tywinWith his other 18,000 men."
2872,tyrionAnd where are they?
2873,"rodrikWe should go, my lady."
2874,catelynNo!
2875,rodrikMy lady!
2876,starkHyah! Hyah!
2877,"robbBy the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
2878,"jaimeLady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
2879,catelynlt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
2880,"jaimel've lost them too, l'm afraid."
2881,"theonKill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
2882,robbHe's more use to us alive than dead.
2883,catelynTake him away and put him in irons.
2884,"jaimeWe could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
2885,"robblf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
2886,"greatjonCome on, pretty man."
2887,"robbl sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
2888,theonThe bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
2889,robbAye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
2890,aryaCould l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
2891,kingsThree coppers.
2892,aryaHow about a nice fat pigeon?
2893,"kingsOh, piss off now. Go on."
2894,aryaDo you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?

I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
2904,"grandAs we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
2905,"joffreyMy mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
2906,"sansaNo, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
2907,"cerseiMy son, this is madness."
2908,populacePut him down!
2909,yorenDon't look!
2910,aryaLet me go.
2911,yorenShut your mouth. Look at me.
2912,"sansaStop him, stop!"
2913,"yorenLook at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."
2914,"yorenKeep your mouth shut, boy."
2915,aryal'm not a boy!
2916,"yorenYou're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north."
2917,"branlt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there."
2918,"oshaYour father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet."
2919,branYou're afraid. Just like Hodor.
2920,oshal'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
2921,branYou've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
2922,"branThat's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father."
2923,oshaYou see? He's not here.
2924,"rickonHere, Shaggydog."
2925,branRickon!
2926,oshaThat beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
2927,rickonHe doesn't like chains.
2928,branWhat are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
2929,"rickonNo, l came to see Father."
2930,branHow many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
2931,rickonHe was down here. l saw him.
2932,branSaw him when?
2933,"rickonLast night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog."
2934,"oshaYou both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –"

2938,catelynShh! Shh! Shh!
2939,robbl'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
2940,catelynMy boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
2941,joffreyVery amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
2942,"marillionl'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear."
2943,"joffreyTell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?"
2944,marillionYour Grace?
2945,"joffreyFingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat."
2946,"marillionEvery man needs hands, Your Grace."
2947,joffreyGood. Tongue it is.
2948,"marillionYour Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace."
2949,"joffreySer llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?"
2950,"marillionl beg you! Please, no. No!"
2951,"marillionYour Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! No!"
2952,"joffreyl'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother."
2953,"marillionYour Grace, please!"
2954,joffreyYou look quite nice.
2955,"sansaThank you, my lord."
2956,joffreyYour Grace. l'm King now.
2957,marillionStop! No!
2958,joffreyWalk with me. l want to show you something.
2959,"sandorDo as you're bid, child."
2960,"joffreyAnd as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long."
2961,"sansaNo! Please, no!"
2962,joffreyThis one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
2963,sansaYou promised to be merciful.
2964,joffreyl was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
2965,"sansaPlease let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –"
2966,"joffreyMother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!"
2967,joffreyWell?
2968,sansaHow long do l have to look?
2969,joffreyAs long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
2970,sansalf it please Your Grace.
2971,"joffreyThat's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well."
2972,sansaOr maybe he'll give me yours.
2973,"sandorHere, girl."
2974,joffreyWill you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
2975,"sandorSave yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants."
2976,sandorYou'll be needing that again.
2977,jonosThe proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
2978,robbRenly is not the king.
2979,"jonosYou cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death."
2980,"robbThat doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
2981,jonosDo you mean to declare us for Stannis?
2982,galbartRenly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
2983,"greatjonMy Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"
2984,rickardl'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!
2985,"theonAm l your brother, now and always?"
2986,robbNow and always.
2987,"theonMy sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
2988,greatjonThe King in the North!
2989,allThe King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
2990,starkLady Stark.
2991,catelynl want to see him. Now! Leave us.
2992,catelynLeave us.
2993,"jaimeYou look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman."
2994,"catelynl will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
2995,"jaimeLet me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long."
2996,"catelynThat is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
2997,"jaimeBut l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
2998,"catelynBecause you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
2999,jaimeWhat gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
3000,catelynBecause of men like you.
3001,jaimeThere are no men like me. Only me.
3002,catelynMy son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
3003,jaimel pushed him out the window.
3004,catelynWhy?
3005,jaimeI hoped the fall would kill him.
3006,jaimeYou should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
3007,"lancell can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
3008,cerseiStop talking. Get back into bed.
3009,tywinThey have my son.
3010,tyrionThe Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
3011,leol've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
3012,addamls it true about Stannis and Renly?
3013,"kevanBoth Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
3014,tyrionThere's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
3015,kevanl'm told we still have his sisters.
3016,leoThe first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
3017,addamKevan Lannister
3018,"tywinThey have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
3019,"tyrionHalf wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
3020,tywinNo one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
3021,tyrionAnd do what?
3022,"tywinRule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
3023,"tyrionHeads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
3024,"tywinYou're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
3025,daenerysSer Jorah?
3026,"jorahGently, gently."
3027,daenerysMy son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
3028,jorahThe boy did not live.
3029,daenerysTell me.
3030,jorahWhat is there to tell?
3031,daenerysHow did my son die?
3032,"jorahHe never lived, my princess. The women say –"
3033,daenerysWhat do the women say?
3034,jorahThey say the child was –
3035,"mirriMonstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
3036,daenerysWhere is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
3037,"mirriAs you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."
3038,jorahTime enough for that later –
3039,daenerysl want to see him now.
3040,daenerysThe khalasar is gone.
3041,"jorahA khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
3042,daenerysDrogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?
3043,"jorahHe seems to like the warmth, Princess."
3044,"mirriHe lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
3045,daenerysThis is not life. When will he be as he was?
3046,"mirriWhen the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
3047,daenerysLeave us.
3048,jorahl don't want you alone with this sorceress.
3049,daenerysl have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
3050,daenerysYou knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
3051,mirrilt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
3052,daenerysThis is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.
3053,mirrilnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
3054,daenerysl spoke for you. l saved you.
3055,"mirriSaved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
3056,daenerysYour life.
3057,mirriWhy don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
3058,samYou can't!
3059,"jonGet out of my way, Sam."
3060,samThey'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
3061,jonBetter than you do.
3062,samWhat are you going to do?

3069,shaeHand of the King?
3070,tyrionSo it would seem.
3071,shaeAnd your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
3072,"tyrionNo, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
3073,shaeHe knew my name?
3074,tyrionWhat?
3075,"shaeHe said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
3076,"tyrionl believe he used the word ""whore""."
3077,shaeAre you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
3078,"shaeI'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
3079,"tyrionMy father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
3080,shael know what a Hand needs.

3085,"grennNo, he's not dead."

3088,pypLucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
3089,jonl belong with my brother.
3090,samBut we're your brothers now.
3091,grennThey'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
3092,jonThey'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
3093,pypSam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
3094,grennBut it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
3095,jonl have to.
3096,grennYou can't. You said the words.
3097,jonI don't care about –
3098,samHear my words and bear witness to my vow
3099,jonTo hell with all of you.
3100,pypNight gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
3101,grennl am the sword in the darkness –
3102,"saml am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”"
3103,"daenerysDo you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
3104,"daenerysWhen the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
3105,"grandKings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
3106,"grandHe is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."
3107,rosSo what's the thing?
3108,grandWhat thing?
3109,"rosAbout kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."
3110,grandWhat? Things? What?
3111,"rosWhen you started, you… Never mind."
3112,"grandLet me see you out, my dear."
3113,roslt's all right. No need.
3114,"grandYes, yes. Till the next time. Right."
3115,"varysWhen you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
3116,petyrlt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
3117,varysA man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
3118,"petyrAnd what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
3119,varysl must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
3120,petyrYou must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
3121,"varysOh, you can do better than that."
3122,"petyrWhen they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
3123,varysHave you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
3124,petyrl picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
3125,"varysl am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
3126,"petyrMust be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
3127,varysAm l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
3128,petyrBut you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
3129,"varysAnd l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
3130,"petyrA useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
3131,varysSo here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
3132,petyrPlaying our roles.
3133,varysServing a new King.
3134,petyrLong may he reign. My king.
3135,varysMy king.
3136,joffreyMy lords. Shall we begin?
3137,"yorenYou're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?"
3138,aryaArry.
3139,"yorenYou've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."
3140,"hotWatch yourself, midget."
3141,"lommyHe's got a sword, this one."
3142,hotWhat's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
3143,lommyMaybe he's a little squire.
3144,hotHe ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
3145,lommyLet's have a look.
3146,hotl could use me a sword like that.
3147,lommyTake it off him.
3148,"hotGive it here, midget."
3149,lommyLook at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
3150,hotl knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
3151,aryaYou want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
3152,"gendryYour like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?"
3153,aryalt was a gift.
3154,"gendrylt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers."
3155,aryaWhich are you?
3156,"gendryArmourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am."
3157,"yorenCome on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!"
3158,jeorHam. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
3159,jonMy friends brought me back.
3160,jeorl didn't say it was your honor.
3161,jonThey killed my father.
3162,"jeorAnd you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"
3163,jonNo.
3164,"jeorWhen dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?"
3165,jeorGood. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
3166,jonBeyond the Wall?
3167,"jeorl'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
3168,"rakharols this your command, Khaleesi?"
3169,jorahDrogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
3170,daenerysThey were not given to me to sell.
3171,"jorahKhaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not."
3172,daenerysl must. You don't understand.
3173,jorahDon't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
3174,"daenerysls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
3175,"daenerysSer Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me."
3176,mirriYou will not hear me scream.
3177,daenerysI will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
3178,jorahBlood of my blood.
3179,"joffreyWell struck… Well struck, Dog."
3180,joffreyDid you like that?
3181,"sansaIt was well struck, Your Grace."

3183,"sansaYes, Your Grace."
3184,joffreyWho's next?
3185,"announcerLothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish."
3186,announcerSer Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
3187,announcerSer Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
3188,"serHere I am. . Here I am. . Sorry, Your Grace. . My deepest apologies. ."
3189,joffreyAre you drunk?
3190,"serNo. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine."
3191,"joffreyTwo cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup."
3192,"serAre you sure, Your Grace?"
3193,"joffreyYes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like."
3194,"serI would be honored, Your Grace."
3195,"joffreySer Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill."
3196,sansaYou can't!
3197,joffreyWhat did you say? Did you say I can't?
3198,sansaI only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
3199,joffreyWhat kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
3200,"sandorThe girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
3201,"joffreyTake him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
3202,sansaHe is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
3203,"joffreyDid you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool."
3204,"serThank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you."
3205,tyrionBeloved nephew.
3206,tyrionWe looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
3207,"joffreyI've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
3208,"tyrionWhat a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."
3209,bronnCan't imagine why.
3210,joffreyWe heard you were dead.
3211,myrcellaI'm glad you're not dead.
3212,"tyrionMe, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
3213,joffreyHer loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
3214,tyrionBut still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
3215,"sansaMy father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
3216,tyrionOf course you are.
3217,"tyrionWell, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
3218,joffreyWhat work? . Why are you here?
3219,"pycelleThe raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
3220,"varysThe peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
3221,pycelleA common superstition.
3222,"petyrWe have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
3223,"janosThe city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
3224,"cerseiYou command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
3225,"janosI do, Your Grace."
3226,cerseiAnd are you not a Lord at my command?
3227,"janosI owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
3228,"cerseiThen do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
3229,"janosYes, Your Grace."
3230,"tyrionDon't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
3231,cerseiWhat are you doing here?
3232,"tyrionIt's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
3233,cerseiWhat are you doing here? This is the small council.
3234,"tyrionYes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
3235,cerseiOur father is Hand of the King.
3236,"tyrionYes, but in his absence…"
3237,varysYour father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
3238,cerseiOut! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
3239,"tyrionIf I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
3240,cerseiI've done nothing.
3241,tyrionQuite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3242,cerseiI tried to stop it.
3243,tyrionDid you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
3244,cerseiRobb Stark is a child.
3245,tyrionWho's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3246,cerseiWhat do you know about warfare?
3247,tyrionNothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
3248,cerseiJoffrey is King.
3249,tyrionJoffrey is King.
3250,cerseiYou are here to advise him.
3251,"tyrionI'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
3252,cerseiHow?
3253,tyrionYou love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
3254,cerseiOne.
3255,tyrionOne?
3256,"cerseiArya, little animal, she disappeared."
3257,"tyrionDisappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
3258,"lordMy Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3259,"lordThe walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
3260,luwinMaintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
3261,"lordGenerally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
3262,branKing Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
3263,"lordMaybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
3264,"branJoffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
3265,lordOf course I remember!
3266,"luwinWe can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
3267,lordI - I believe it will.
3268,"luwinWe didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3269,branI didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3270,luwinNor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
3271,"portanMy Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3272,oshaBoil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
3273,branDon't have any pain.
3274,oshaLucky for you.
3275,branThat way.
3276,oshaYou've been having those dreams again.
3277,branI don't dream.
3278,oshaEveryone dreams.
3279,branI don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3280,"oshaDid they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3281,"oshaThe stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
3282,branThe dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
3283,"doreahWhat did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
3284,daenerysHe said they ate meat.
3285,doreahHe didn't tell you what kind of meat?
3286,daenerysMy brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
3287,daenerysShe was Drogo's first gift to me.
3288,jorahI remember.
3289,daenerysI promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
3290,"jorahA trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
3291,daenerysDoes it ever end?
3292,"jorahThis is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
3293,daenerysAnd you're sure there's no other way?
3294,"jorahIf we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
3295,daenerysNo one will take my dragons.
3296,"jorahThey are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
3297,daenerysAs you are mine.
3298,"daenerysRakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
3299,"rakharoWhat do we seek, Khaleesi?"
3300,"daenerysCities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3301,"daenerysRokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
3302,"rakharoI will not fail you, blood of my blood."
3303,daenerysYou never have.
3304,rakharoThis is… bad time to start.
3305,jonHaving a rough time of it?
3306,samNothing's killed me yet.
3307,grennYour ass killed the sledge.
3308,samYou offered me a ride!
3309,grennI just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
3310,"eddI was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
3311,samAre those girls?
3312,eddCraster's daughters.
3313,samI haven't seen a girl in six months.
3314,eddI'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
3315,"grennWhat, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
3316,eddHe don't like people messing with his wives.
3317,"eddHe marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."
3318,samThat's foul.
3319,grennIt's beyond foul.
3320,eddAll the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
3321,jonWhat happens to the boys?
3322,samHmm?
3323,jonHe marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
3324,lordHe said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
3325,"crasterPeople make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
3326,jonWe're not Southerners.
3327,crasterWho's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
3328,jonJon Snow.
3329,"crasterSnow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
3330,lordThe lad meant no harm.
3331,crasterI catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
3332,"lordNo one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
3333,crasterYou bring any of that good wine with you?
3334,lordWe did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
3335,"crasterI could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
3336,lordThere's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
3337,"watchmanYes, commander."
3338,crasterYou want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
3339,"lordHe's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
3340,"crasterOh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
3341,lordHe's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
3342,crasterThat's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
3343,lordGive it here.
3344,lordYou'll have another one made at Castle Black. . Here.
3345,"crasterOh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings."
3346,lordAnd where does he plan marching this army?
3347,"crasterWhen you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
3348,lordThese are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
3349,"crasterLet them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
3350,gillyThis is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
3351,"crasterDon't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
3352,lordWe chose different paths.
3353,"crasterOh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
3354,lordA roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
3355,"crasterAny man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
3356,"lordYour roof, your rules."
3357,lordWho am I? Who am I?
3358,jonLord commander.
3359,lordAnd who are you?
3360,lordWho are you?
3361,jonYour steward.
3362,lordYou want to lead one day? . Then learn how to follow.
3363,"melisandreLord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods."
3364,melisandreTake them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3365,groupFor the night is dark and full of terrors.
3366,"melisandreAfter the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed."
3367,cressenWe need to stop her!
3368,melisandreThe cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
3369,davosNot now.
3370,melisandreAnd the dead shall rise in the North.
3371,cressenAll you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
3372,"melisandreYou smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
3373,"melisandreIn the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."
3374,"crowdLord, cast your light upon us!"
3375,melisandreFor the night is dark and full of terrors.
3376,stannisFor the night is dark and full of terror.
3377,cressenThis woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
3378,"davosStannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
3379,"cressenKing. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
3380,davosI don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
3381,"cressenAs do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth…"
3382,davosWhat's the truth?
3383,matthosAnd I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
3384,"stannisHe wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
3385,"davosA harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
3386,stannisA lie. Take it out.
3387,"matthosThat my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""
3388,"stannisJaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is."
3389,"matthosAnd her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"
3390,"stannisMake it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
3391,"matthosSer Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. . Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
3392,"stannisWhen Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
3393,"davosYour Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
3394,stannisI'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
3395,"davosWell, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
3396,melisandreStannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
3397,davosAnd how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
3398,melisandreHe has no need for ships.
3399,"davosI'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
3400,"stannisWho would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
3401,"cressenI owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?"
3402,davosDon't.
3403,cressenA cup of wine to honor the one true God.
3404,"melisandreThe night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
3405,"jaimeKing in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
3406,"robbIf I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
3407,jaimeYou don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
3408,"robbOh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
3409,jaimeSmart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?
3410,"robbYou insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
3411,robbYou're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.
3412,"jaimeIf that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
3413,robbMy father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
3414,jaimeI was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
3415,robbYour son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
3416,jaimeYou have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
3417,robbI'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3418,jaimeYou think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3419,"robbNo, but he's starting to know me."
3420,jaimeThree victories don't make you a conqueror.
3421,robbIt's better than three defeats.
3422,shaeThis city stinks Like dead bodies.
3423,"tyrionA bit corpsey, yes."
3424,shaeAnd shit.
3425,tyrionI thought you wanted to come here.
3426,shaeI love it.
3427,tyrionYou love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
3428,shaeAnd cum and garlic and rum.
3429,tyrionYou can smell cum from the balcony?
3430,shaeI love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
3431,tyrionAnd so did the country.
3432,shaeThis is where I belong.
3433,"tyrionYes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
3434,shaeNo one will know.
3435,"tyrionYou can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
3436,shaeWhat about you?
3437,tyrionMe? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
3438,shaeTruth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
3439,"tyrionWhy do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
3440,"tyrionNed Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
3441,cerseiLord Baelish.
3442,petyrYour Grace.
3443,cerseiI wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
3444,"petyrOf course, Your Grace."
3445,cerseiNed Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
3446,"petyrIf she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
3447,cerseiAnd yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
3448,petyrCurious.
3449,"cerseiIf we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
3450,"petyrWell, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
3451,"cerseiA mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
3452,petyrYes.
3453,cerseiAppropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
3454,petyrI'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
3455,"cerseiI heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
3456,"petyrWhen boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
3457,cerseiAnd which truth is that?
3458,petyrKnowledge is power.
3459,cerseiSeize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
3460,robbYou're Ser Alton Lannister?
3461,"altonI am, Your Grace."
3462,"robbI offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
3463,"altonAn honorable request, Your Grace."
3464,"robbThird... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
3465,serThe King in the North.
3466,othersKing in the North.
3467,"robbNeither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
3468,"altonThese are... Your Grace, these are..."
3469,"robbThese are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
3470,"altonKing Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
3471,"robbOh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
3472,"theonA word, Your Grace?"
3473,robbYou don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
3474,theonIt's not so bad once you get used to it.
3475,robbI'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
3476,"theonThe Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
3477,robbOf course they are.
3478,"theonWe can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
3479,robbMen who fought my father.
3480,"theonMen who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
3481,catelynYou don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3482,robbI need his ships. They say he has 200.
3483,catelynThey say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
3484,robbI understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
3485,catelynI don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
3486,"robbYes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
3487,"catelynI mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
3488,"robbIf I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
3489,"catelynYou want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
3490,robbIt's more complicated than that! You know it is.
3491,catelynIt's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
3492,robbYou can't go to Winterfell.
3493,catelynI beg your pardon?
3494,"robbI'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
3495,catelynWhy in the name of all the Gods -
3496,"robbBecause I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
3497,catelynI haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
3498,"robbWhich of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
3499,catelynI will ride at first light.
3500,"robbWe will all be together again soon, I promise."
3501,catelynYou've done so well. Your father would be proud.
3502,robbGive Lord Renly my regards.
3503,catelynKing Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
3504,cerseiWhat is all this?
3505,"joffreyReturning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
3506,cerseiWe can't find Arya Stark.
3507,"joffreyWith luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
3508,"cerseiPerhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
3509,joffreyI think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
3510,cerseiWe need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
3511,joffreyThe King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
3512,cerseiHis life is in danger.
3513,joffreyWe're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
3514,cerseiOur enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
3515,joffreyIt's not a claim. The throne is mine.
3516,cerseiOf course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
3517,joffreySomeone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
3518,cerseiWhat are you asking?
3519,joffreyI'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

3600,goldI have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
3601,"yorenWell the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3602,"yorenIt's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3603,yorenWe'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
3604,goldWe're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
3605,varysMy lord.
3606,"shaeYou make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
3607,varysWe were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
3608,tyrionIt was quite a battle.
3609,varysI heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
3610,shaeAnd I tell him the story of how we meet.
3611,varysTo find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
3612,tyrionStrange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
3613,shaeI don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
3614,varysHow can you tell?
3615,shaeI can always tell.
3616,tyrionMen like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .

3637,varysTrouble with the wildlings?
3638,petyrThat's why they're called wildlings.
3639,varysSomewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
3640,"cerseiAnother king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
3641,tyrionLord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
3642,cerseiPerhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
3643,"tyrionCold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
3644,pycelleThe northerners are a superstitious people.
3645,"tyrionAccording to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
3646,varysHow do you kill a dead man?
3647,tyrionApparently you burn him.
3648,cerseiOne trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
3649,"tyrionI don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."

3659,samI'm sure that's nice too.
3660,"grennWell, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed."

3686,samYou were cruel.
3687,jonCruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
3688,samI didn't touch her!
3689,jonNo you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
3690,"samI can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
3691,"jonWe're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
3692,samI could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.

3709,womanWho will?
3710,"theonAnyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."

3718,"theonQuit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."

3732,"rozCan't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
3733,"petyrYou know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."

3749,janosOrders are orders.
3750,tyrionQuite right. Especially the queen's orders.
3751,janosI never said they were the queen's orders.

3753,janosYou know your sister better than I do.
3754,tyrionYou've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
3755,janosI don't listen to filth.

3761,janosAre you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
3762,"tyrionI'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."

3764,"tyrionDwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
3765,"tyrionI intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
3766,janosWhat are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
3767,tyrionThe queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
3768,janosWe shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
3769,"tyrionNo, we shan't."
3770,"tyrionThere's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."

3791,"aryaGendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
3792,hotIt's when they've got armor on.
3793,gendryNow who told you that.
3794,hotA knight?
3795,gendryHow'd you know he was a knight?
3796,"hotWell, cause he got armor on."
3797,gendryYou don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
3798,hotHow'd you know?
3799,gendryCause I sold armor.
3800,aryaWhat do the gold cloaks want with you?
3801,gendryNo idea.
3802,aryaYou're a liar.
3803,gendryYou shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
3804,aryaThen I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
3805,"gendryWell, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions."
3806,aryaNo goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
3807,gendryHow can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
3808,aryaWho asked questions?
3809,"gendryThe Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
3810,aryaLord Stark.
3811,gendrySee? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
3812,aryaWhat did they ask about?
3813,gendryMy mom.
3814,aryaWho's your mom?
3815,gendryJust my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
3816,aryaAnd who was your father?
3817,"gendryHe could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
3818,aryaI'm not a girl!
3819,gendryYes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
3820,"aryaStupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
3821,gendryThat's true. You're still a girl.
3822,aryaI am not!
3823,"gendryWell, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
3824,aryaI don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
3825,gendryThey won't. Not from me.
3826,aryaMy name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
3827,gendryHe was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
3828,aryaHe was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
3829,"gendrySo you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
3830,"aryaNo. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
3831,"gendryYou were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
3832,aryaDo not call me milady.
3833,"gendryAs milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike."
3834,manWhat you carrying?
3835,theonPears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
3836,manDon't like wine. Woman's drink. .
3837,theonI need to get to Pyke.
3838,manI'll find you a horse.
3839,yaraI'm heading that way. I can take you there.
3840,theonI bet you can.
3841,yaraYou been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
3842,theonNone like you.
3843,yaraYou don't know what I'm like.
3844,theonYou don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
3845,yaraYou think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
3846,theonHave my things sent up to the castle.
3847,"theonYou should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
3848,yaraNine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
3849,theonDon't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
3850,yaraYour blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
3851,"theonI have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
3852,yaraIs that an offer from my future king?
3853,"theonAn order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
3854,yaraI don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
3855,theonFather.
3856,"balonNine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
3857,theonA man. Your blood and your heir.
3858,balonWe shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
3859,theonLord Stark is gone.
3860,balonAnd how do you feel about that?
3861,theonWhat's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
3862,balonWho gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
3863,"theonIf my clothes offend you, I will change them."
3864,balonIt will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
3865,theonGold.
3866,balonI'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
3867,theonMy blood is salt and iron.
3868,"balonYet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
3869,"theonThe offer he makes, is one I proposed."
3870,balonHe heeds your counsel?
3871,"theonI've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
3872,"balonNo, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
3873,theonI forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
3874,balonI see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
3875,theonI will lead the attack myself.
3876,"balonOh, you will?"
3877,theonI'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
3878,theonI told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
3879,yaraAnything with a cock is easy to fool.
3880,balonMy dear.
3881,theonYara?
3882,"yaraSo good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
3883,theonShe can't lead an attack!
3884,balonAnd why not?
3885,theonYou're a woman!
3886,yaraYou're the one in skirts.
3887,"balonThis isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
3888,allWhat's dead may never die.
3889,balonNo man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
3890,theonYou won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
3891,balonWho said anything about the Lannisters?
3892,davosYou'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
3893,"saanAll these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
3894,"davosBecause you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
3895,"saanAnd yet, they both have larger armies."
3896,davosStannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
3897,saanWhat is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
3898,"matthosMind your words, pirate. ."
3899,davosMatthos.
3900,saanYou think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
3901,"davosOf course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
3902,saanThat's a promise that always comes true.
3903,"davosAs is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
3904,saanOnly the clever ones.
3905,"davosYou want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
3906,saanSalladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
3907,davosIt is. .
3908,"saanOne thing, I want the queen."
3909,davosThe queen?
3910,"saanCersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
3911,matthosThis war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
3912,"saanI'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
3913,matthosAs if she would just let you!
3914,saanYou don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
3915,"matthosStannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
3916,"saanI've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
3917,saanI never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
3918,davosHe's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
3919,matthosYou believe your king can win?
3920,davosHe is the one true king.
3921,"saanYou Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
3922,davosGet me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
3923,matthosWhen will the King have a sail?
3924,davosAs soon as his God wills it.
3925,"matthosHe's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
3926,davosOh you and your mother.
3927,matthosIt won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
3928,"davosI wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
3929,matthosBut you always came home.
3930,davosI wasn't praying.
3931,"matthosBut I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
3932,"davosYou want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
3933,"matthosStannis is my king, but he's only a man."
3934,davosDon't tell him that.
3935,cerseiLord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
3936,tyrionI have every right. I am the King's Hand.
3937,cerseiYou're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
3938,"tyrionListen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
3939,"cerseiHa, the people. You think I care?"
3940,"tyrionYou might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
3941,"tyrionIt wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
3942,"cerseiHe did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
3943,"tyrionI'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
3944,"cerseiI don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
3945,"tyrionAs has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
3946,"cerseiYou're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
3947,tyrionShe was my mother too.
3948,"cerseiNow they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
3949,davosYour Grace.
3950,matthosYour Grace.
3951,stannisHow did it fare with your pirate?
3952,davosSalladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
3953,"stannisIn my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
3954,davosDoes seem the wiser choice.
3955,stannisIt won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
3956,"davosSalladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
3957,"stannisWell if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
3958,"davosAt once, Your Grace."
3959,"melisandreThe Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
3960,davosCome.
3961,stannisWhat did you say to him?
3962,melisandreI told him death by fire is the purest death.
3963,stannisWhy?
3964,melisandreBecause it is true. You're troubled my king.
3965,stannisYeah.
3966,melisandreThese armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
3967,stannisTell your lord to burn them then.
3968,melisandreI tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
3969,stannisMy little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
3970,melisandreYou must have faith.
3971,"stannisFaith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
3972,melisandreThen we must be the ten.
3973,"stannisI cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
3974,"melisandreI have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
3975,"stannisI've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
3976,melisandreYou must give... all of yourself.
3977,stannisI have a wife. I took a vow.
3978,"melisandreShe's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
3979,stannisA son?
3980,"crasterOut, all of you."
3981,crasterThis bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
3982,crasterI want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
3983,jeorWait outside.
3984,jonLord Commander-
3985,jeorNow!
3986,samLord Commander-
3987,jeorLeave us.
3988,jeorWhat did you do?
3989,"jonI followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
3990,jeorWhat business is that of yours?
3991,"jonNo, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
3992,jonYou know.
3993,jeorWildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
3994,jonOfferings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
3995,"jeorAye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
3996,jonI... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
3997,"jeorYeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
3998,jeorDon't lose it again.
3999,samGilly.
4000,gillyYou're leaving.
4001,"samI, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
4002,gillyI can't take it.
4003,samPlease. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
4004,"gillyYou, you shouldn't give it away."
4005,samI'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
4006,samKeep it safe for me. Til I come back.
4007,hodorHodor.
4008,"luwinHodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
4009,branEvery night it's the same.
4010,"branI'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
4011,"luwinThat's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
4012,branSo she was lying? They don't exist?
4013,"luwinWell, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
4014,"branNo, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
4015,luwinWhat about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
4016,"luwinThis link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
4017,luwinAll right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
4018,margaeryLoras! Highgarden!
4019,manGet him!
4020,crowdOh!
4021,lorasYield! I yield.
4022,renlyWell fought. Approach.
4023,renlyRise. Remove your helm.
4024,"renlyYou are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
4025,"margaeryNow, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
4026,"renlyThat he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
4027,"brienneYour Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
4028,lorasWhat?
4029,"brienneI will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
4030,"renlyDone. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
4031,"colenYour Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
4032,catelynLord of Winterfell and King in the North.
4033,"renlyLady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
4034,"margaeryYou are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
4035,catelynYou are most kind.
4036,"renlyMy lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
4037,"catelynIt will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
4038,brienneYour Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
4039,renlyThere's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
4040,lorasHas your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
4041,"catelynI do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
4042,"lorasIf Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
4043,"catelynMy son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
4044,"renlyDon't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
4045,gerardYour Grace.
4046,renlyGerard. How's your foot?
4047,"gerardBetter, Your Grace."
4048,gerardThey don't know their own size is all.
4049,renlyGood man.
4050,renlyI have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
4051,"catelynAnd all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
4052,renlyWhy?
4053,catelynBecause it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
4054,"renlyBrienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
4055,"brienneAt once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
4056,renlyThat won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
4057,"brienneIf you'll follow me, my lady."
4058,"catelynYou fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
4059,"brienneI fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
4060,theonWhat are you doing here?
4061,"yaraI live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
4062,theonYou lying bitch.
4063,yaraIt's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
4064,theonRecognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
4065,"yaraYou were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
4066,theonWhy didn't you tell me?
4067,yaraI wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
4068,balonThe plans are made. It's time you heard them.
4069,yaraFather.
4070,theonFather.
4071,"balonThe wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
4072,"balonYara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
4073,yaraI've always wanted a castle.
4074,theonAnd what's my role in all this?
4075,balonYou'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
4076,theonA ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
4077,yaraThe Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
4078,theonI'm to fight fishermen?
4079,yaraBe careful of their nets.
4080,"theonFather, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
4081,yaraThey won't even know we're there until it's too late.
4082,"theonWhat do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
4083,"balonYour brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
4084,"theonI'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
4085,balonWhat are our words? Our words?
4086,theonWe do not sow.
4087,balonWe do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4088,"theonYou act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
4089,theonYou gave me away!
4090,theonYour boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
4091,yaraYou'd have our father bow down to your other family?
4092,theonI have no other family.
4093,"yaraDon't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
4094,shaeYou won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
4095,tyrionKeep your voice down.
4096,shaeWhy? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
4097,tyrionI don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
4098,"tyrionAgain, only temporary."
4099,shaeEvery man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
4100,tyrionBut you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
4101,shaeScullion? What is a scullion?
4102,tyrionKitchen wench.
4103,shaeA kitchen wench?
4104,"tyrionYes, but-"
4105,shaeCleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
4106,tyrionYour lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
4107,shaeI'm the weakness?
4108,"tyrionIt's a compliment, my lady."
4109,shaeHow is being a weakness a compliment?
4110,tyrionLanguage can be a bit tricky here.
4111,"shaeOh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
4112,myrcellaWhen will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
4113,"cerseiSoon, darling, when the war is over."
4114,"myrcellaMother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
4115,cerseiThe princess just spoke to you.
4116,"sansaPardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
4117,tommenIs Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
4118,cerseiHe might.
4119,cerseiWould you like that?
4120,tommenNo. I don't think so.
4121,"cerseiEven if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
4122,sansaCome in.
4123,sansaWho are you?
4124,"shaeI'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
4125,sansaI didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
4126,shaeNo.
4127,sansaWhat are you doing?
4128,shaeWaiting for you to tell me what to do.
4129,sansaI shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
4130,shaeWhat things?
4131,"sansaChange my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
4132,sansaNo.
4133,shaeYou said to brush your-
4134,sansaNot now.
4135,shaeYour chamber pot is empty.
4136,sansaClean the table.
4137,sansaHave you ever been a handmaiden before?
4138,shaeYes.
4139,sansaFor whom?
4140,shaeLady Zuriff.
4141,sansaLady Zuriff
4142,sansaThere is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
4143,shaeShe wasn't in this city.
4144,"sansaI don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
4145,shaeDo you want me to leave?
4146,sansaJust brush my hair.
4147,tyrionOh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
4148,"pycelleI've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4149,tyrionRight. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
4150,tyrionPlease.
4151,"pycelleThank you, my lord."
4152,"tyrionI can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
4153,"pycelleWhy, yes, of course, my lord."
4154,tyrionThese are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4155,"pycelleMatrimony, huh? Yes."
4156,"tyrionI'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4157,"pycelleOh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4158,"tyrionI'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4159,pycelleMyrcella sent away to Dorne?
4160,"tyrionBut remember, the Queen mustn't know."
4161,"varysOoh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
4162,tyrionI plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4163,"varysTheon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4164,tyrionPrecisely.
4165,tyrionTheon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4166,"tyrionBut remember, you must tell no one."
4167,petyrTell no one what?
4168,tyrionI plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4169,petyrShe imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4170,"tyrionFor men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4171,petyrAnd I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4172,tyrionWho better?
4173,"petyrYes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4174,"tyrionThe gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4175,petyrHarrenhal is cursed.
4176,"tyrionNever took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4177,"petyrWith a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4178,tyrionYou served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4179,"petyrSo did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4180,"tyrionI need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
4181,tyrionGood. Oh. And remember-
4182,petyrThe Queen mustn't know.
4183,renlyThat must hurt.
4184,renlyWhat? What is it?
4185,lorasA member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
4186,renlyBrienne is a very capable warrior.
4187,renlyAnd she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
4188,lorasJealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
4189,renlyI'll make it up to you.
4190,"lorasNo, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4191,lorasYour vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
4192,renlyAnd Margaery's a virgin?
4193,lorasOfficially. Shall I bring her to you?
4194,"renlyI should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
4195,margaeryAs is your right. You are a king.
4196,renlyYou look very beautiful.
4197,"margaeryThank you, Your Grace."
4198,renlyIt's a lovely gown.
4199,"margaeryYou think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
4200,renlyYou certainly don't need it.
4201,"renlyAlthough, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
4202,renlyMust be the wine.
4203,"margaeryHere, let me."
4204,renlyI'm sorry.
4205,margaeryDo you want my brother to come in and help?
4206,renlyWhat?
4207,margaeryHe could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
4208,renlyI don't know what you're talking about.
4209,margaeryThere's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
4210,"margaeryYour enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
4211,margaeryWhatever you need to do. You are a king.
4212,cerseiYou monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
4213,tyrionMyrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
4214,cerseiI will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
4215,tyrionDorne is the safest place for her.
4216,cerseiAre you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4217,tyrionThat's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
4218,cerseiShe'll be a hostage.
4219,tyrionA guest.
4220,"cerseiYou won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
4221,"tyrionIt's done, Cersei."
4222,cerseiNo.
4223,tyrionYou cannot stop it.
4224,cerseiNo!
4225,"tyrionJust how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
4226,cerseiGet out! Get out!
4227,"priestTheon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
4228,theonI would.
4229,drownedKneel.
4230,"drownedLet Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
4231,theonWhat is dead may never die.
4232,drownedWhat is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
4233,"petyrI don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
4234,"tyrionNo, afraid not. Sorry about that."
4235,"petyrAnd Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
4236,"tyrionYes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
4237,petyrLeave me out of your next deception.
4238,"tyrionOh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
4239,petyrRobb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
4240,"tyrionNo, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
4241,tyrionFind him?
4242,"bronnOh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
4243,"tyrionNo, you don't."
4244,"bronnNo, I don't."
4245,pycelleWhat is the meaning of this?
4246,"pycelleNo, please, please."
4247,"tyrionYou disappoint me, Grand Maester."
4248,pycelleI am your loyal servant.
4249,tyrionSo loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4250,"pycelleNo! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4251,"tyrionSee, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
4252,pycelleThe eunuch has spies everywhere.
4253,tyrionCut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
4254,"pycelleNo, no, no."
4255,"timettThere are no goats, halfman."
4256,"tyrionWell, make do."
4257,tyrionHow long have you been spying for my sister?
4258,"pycelleAll I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
4259,tyrionI don't like his beard.
4260,pycelleWhat? What?
4261,"pycelleOh, no. No."
4262,"tyrionHow many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
4263,"pycelleOh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
4264,tyrionSo you poisoned him?
4265,pycelleNo. Never.
4266,"tyrionBut you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
4267,"pycelleLannister, I always served Lannister."
4268,tyrionGet him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
4269,"pycelleOh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
4270,tyrionFor your trouble.
4271,varysYou'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
4272,tyrionGood. One of my better ideas.
4273,varysAnd it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4274,"varysWell played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4275,tyrionThe Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4276,"varysPower is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4277,"tyrionWhy, am I about to hear one?"
4278,"varysThree great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4279,tyrionDepends on the sellsword.
4280,varysDoes it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4281,"tyrionHe has a sword, the power of life and death."
4282,"varysBut if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4283,tyrionI've decided I don't like riddles.
4284,"varysPower resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
4285,"yorenYou should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
4286,aryaI can't sleep.
4287,aryaI don't like the taste.
4288,"yorenWell... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
4289,yorenWhat?
4290,aryaHow do you sleep?
4291,"yorenSame as most men, I think."
4292,"aryaBut you've seen things, horrible things."
4293,"yorenAye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
4294,aryaHow do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
4295,yorenYou didn't see that. I made damn sure.
4296,"aryaI close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
4297,"yorenYou know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
4298,"yorenHo! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
4299,gendryGet up.
4300,aryaGet up.
4301,"yorenKeep out of sight, both of you."
4302,"aryaNo, I'm not afraid."
4303,gendryI can fight.
4304,"yorenKeep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
4305,"yorenHey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
4306,"manCome on, move, move!"
4307,guardIt's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
4308,rennickBulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
4309,"guardIf the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
4310,rennickIf he ever gets out.
4311,guardLoras Tyrell?
4312,rennickLoras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
4313,guardI don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
4314,"rennickHow good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
4315,rennickThe horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
4316,guardThey get spooked by their own shadows.
4317,rennickShh. Do you hear that?
4318,guardNo.
4319,rennickThere's something out there.
4320,"guardOh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
4321,"rennickI swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
4322,guardThere is something out there.
4323,"rennickYeah, don't even try me."
4324,guardRennick.
4325,rennickDo you think I'm an idiot?
4326,guardRennick!
4327,manKing in the North!
4328,menThe King in the North!
4329,rooseFive Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
4330,"robbWe're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
4331,"rooseOf course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
4332,robbI doubt it.
4333,"rooseWell, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
4334,robbMy father outlawed flaying in the North.
4335,rooseWe're not in the North.
4336,robbWe're not torturing them.
4337,"rooseThe high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."
4338,robbThe Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
4339,"woundedNo, don't! Don't! Please!"
4340,talisaShhh.
4341,talisaThe rot's set in.
4342,"woundedNo, don't! No, don't!"
4343,talisaShh.
4344,"woundedPlease, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
4345,talisaThe rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
4346,"woundedNo, you can't!"
4347,"woundedSer! Please, ser. I can't lose-"
4348,robbYou'll die if she doesn't.
4349,"woundedI don't want to be a cripple, please."
4350,rooseSurely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
4351,"talisaYour men are not my men, my lord."
4352,robbPut this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
4353,woundedNo! You can't!
4354,"robbBite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
4355,robbWhat's your name?
4356,talisaTalisa.
4357,robbYour last name?
4358,talisaYou want to know what side my family fights on?
4359,robbYou know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
4360,talisaThat boy lost his foot on your orders.
4361,robbThey killed my father.
4362,talisaThat boy did?
4363,robbThe family he fights for.
4364,talisaDo you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
4365,robbI have no hatred for the lad.
4366,talisaThat should help his foot grow back.
4367,"robbYou'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
4368,talisaYou're going to kill Joffrey?
4369,robbIf the gods give me strength.
4370,talisaAnd then what?
4371,robbI don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
4372,talisaSo who will?
4373,robbI don't know.
4374,"talisaYou're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
4375,robbFirst we have to win the war.
4376,robbYou never told me where you're from.
4377,talisaVolantis.
4378,robbVolantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
4379,talisaHe was unlucky that you were.
4380,joffreyYou're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
4381,"sansaYour Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
4382,"joffreySer Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
4383,"lancelUsing some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
4384,joffreyKilling you would send your brother a message.
4385,joffreyBut my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
4386,joffreyLeave her face. I like her pretty.
4387,"joffreyMeryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
4388,"joffreyIf you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
4389,tyrionWhat is the meaning of this?
4390,tyrionWhat kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
4391,"merynThe kind who serves his king, Imp."
4392,"bronnCareful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
4393,tyrionSomeone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
4394,joffreyI'm punishing her.
4395,"tyrionFor what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
4396,joffreyYou can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
4397,tyrionThe Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
4398,merynNo one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
4399,"tyrionI'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
4400,tyrionI apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
4401,"sansaI am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
4402,"tyrionLady Stark, you may survive us yet."
4403,bronnThe little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
4404,tyrionYou think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
4405,bronnThere's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
4406,"joffreyWhat are you doing here, dog?"
4407,sandorYour uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
4408,joffreyAnd? What is it?
4409,"sandorLook inside, Your Grace."
4410,daisyYour Grace.
4411,"rosHappy nameday, Your Grace."
4412,joffreyMy nameday has passed.
4413,rosWe won't tell if you won't.
4414,joffreyNo. Her. Touch her.
4415,joffreyCould you hit her?
4416,joffreyMy uncle sent you?
4417,"daisyYes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
4418,rosHmm.
4419,joffreyUse this.
4420,joffreyHarder.
4421,joffreyI said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
4422,"rosYour Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
4423,"daisyPlease, Your Grace."
4424,"rosYour Grace, if your uncle finds out"
4425,"joffreyOh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
4426,joffreyBegin.
4427,joffreyHarder!
4428,"renlyWell, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
4429,petyrYour Grace.
4430,"renlyNow you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
4431,petyrI'm a practical man.
4432,renlyJust not a loyal one.
4433,petyrAnd who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
4434,"renlyI don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
4435,renlyYou can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
4436,"petyrYou still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
4437,"renlyNow I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
4438,petyrI would give priority to my head.
4439,"petyrI understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
4440,margaeryLord Baelish.
4441,petyrAll of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
4442,"margaeryIt would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
4443,"petyrYour tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
4444,"margaeryI am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
4445,"petyrIf war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
4446,margaeryThe place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
4447,"petyrAnd on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
4448,margaeryYou seem quite interested in our marriage.
4449,"petyrYour marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
4450,"margaeryYou've never married, have you?"
4451,"petyrI've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
4452,"margaeryThat is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
4453,daenerysThis isn't your horse.
4454,kovarroIt was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
4455,daenerysQarth?
4456,"kovarroThree days to the east, on the sea."
4457,daenerysWill they let us in?
4458,kovarroThey said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
4459,daenerysWhat do you know of this place?
4460,"jorahOnly that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
4461,manGo on!
4462,"manYou, keep moving!"
4463,manBring her about!

4469,aryaDead people.
4470,soldierMove.
4471,"manPlease, please, no, no! No."
4472,"womanHe's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."

4475,aryaJoffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4476,catelynHow dare you?
4477,petyrYou may have heard false reports.
4478,catelynYou betrayed Ned.
4479,petyrBetrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
4480,catelynI trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
4481,"petyrNo, my lady."
4482,catelynGet out!
4483,"petyrCat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
4484,catelynHave you lost your mind? Get out!
4485,"petyrDo you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
4486,"catelynYou have Arya, too?"
4487,petyrBoth girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
4488,catelynWhat do you want?
4489,petyrThe Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
4490,catelynOf course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
4491,petyrI'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
4492,catelynYou think I keep secrets from my son?
4493,"petyrRobb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
4494,catelynI don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
4495,catelynGood faith?
4496,catelynWhat's this?
4497,petyrYour husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
4498,catelynGet out.
4499,"manGet up, you dogs!"
4500,"hotThat's him, the one who picks."
4501,aryaThe Mountain. What are you doing?
4502,hotHe told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
4503,mountainYou.
4504,"soldierMove, boy! Move!"
4505,ticklerIs there gold and silver in the village?
4506,prisonerI don't know.
4507,ticklerGems?
4508,prisonerI didn't see any.
4509,ticklerWhere is the Brotherhood?
4510,prisonerI don't know. Please.
4511,ticklerWhich of the villagers aided them?
4512,ticklerWho?
4513,prisonerI-
4514,"prisonerI never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
4515,prisonerI didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
4516,ticklerWho helped him?
4517,"prisonerGanes, the butcher, and his son."
4518,ticklerThat's better. You've been very helpful.
4519,"prisonerNo, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
4520,prisonerNo! No! I told you everything! No! No!
4521,aryaJoffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4522,"womanPlease, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
4523,aryaPolliver. The Mountain.
4524,"stannisLady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
4525,"catelynI had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
4526,renlyCan that truly be you?
4527,stannisWho else might it be?
4528,"renlyWhen I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
4529,stannisMy own.
4530,"renlyI suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
4531,melisandreThe king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
4532,"renlyAh, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
4533,"stannisWatch yourself, Renly."
4534,"renlyNo, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
4535,"melisandreYou should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
4536,renlyBorn amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
4537,stannisThat's twice I've warned you.
4538,"catelynListen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
4539,"stannisIt is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
4540,catelynWe share a common enemy.
4541,stannisThe Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4542,"renlyThe whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
4543,"stannisFor the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
4544,"renlyLook across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
4545,stannisYou think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
4546,renlyNo. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
4547,"stannisWe shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
4548,"melisandreLook to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
4549,renlyWould you believe I loved him once?
4550,daenerysI thought we were welcome.
4551,"jorahIf you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
4552,daenerysHorde?
4553,daenerysMy name is Daenerys-
4554,spiceDaenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
4555,"daenerysYou know me, my lord?"
4556,"spiceOnly by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
4557,daenerysAnd what should I call you?
4558,"spiceOh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
4559,daenerysThe beauty of Quarth is legendary-
4560,spiceKING Qarth.
4561,daenerysQarth.
4562,spiceMight we see the dragons?
4563,"daenerysMy friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
4564,"spiceForgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
4565,daenerysI am not a liar.
4566,"spiceOh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
4567,"daenerysWhere I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
4568,spiceThen perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
4569,daenerysWhat are you doing? You promised to receive me.
4570,"spiceWe have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
4571,"daenerysIf you do not let us in, all of us will die."
4572,spiceWhich we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
4573,"jorahKhaleesi, please be careful."
4574,"daenerysThirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
4575,"spiceAh. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
4576,xaroRetreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
4577,"spiceThe discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
4578,"xaroI am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
4579,spiceThe girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
4580,"xaroDo you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
4581,spiceOur decision is final.
4582,xaroVery well. I invoke soumai.
4583,"xaroI will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
4584,spiceBe it on your head.
4585,"xaroWelcome to Qarth, my lady."
4586,ticklerIs there gold or silver in the village?
4587,gendryI'm not from the village.
4588,gendryI don't know what that is.
4589,manYou two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
4590,tywinWhat's this?
4591,"mountainWe weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
4592,tywinEvidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
4593,"mountainCells are overflowing, my lord."
4594,"polliverThis lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
4595,tywinAre we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
4596,"tywinYou, do you have a trade?"
4597,"gendrySmith, my lord."
4598,"polliverWhat are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
4599,"tywinHe'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
4600,"aryaSafer to travel, my lord."
4601,tywinSmart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
4602,mountainMy lord.
4603,"tyrionYour visits are too few, cousin."
4604,"lancelHer Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
4605,tyrionSo it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4606,"lancelI am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4607,"tyrionIf my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4608,"lancelI don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4609,tyrionAnd you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4610,lancelAs I said several times.
4611,tyrionAnd you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4612,"lancelWhen the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4613,"tyrionCersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4614,lancelThe Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4615,tyrionShe must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4616,"tyrionAh. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4617,lancelI am a knight!
4618,"tyrionAn anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4619,lancelYou will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4620,tyrionHave you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4621,lancelIt's not my fault!
4622,"tyrionDid she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4623,"lancelYour own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4624,"tyrionDid he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4625,lancelI only meant I did as I was bid.
4626,"tyrionHated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4627,"lancelMercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4628,tyrionSave it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4629,"lancelMy lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4630,"tyrionNo, I think not."
4631,lancelMy lord?
4632,"tyrionYou heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4633,"lancelYes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4634,"tyrionOh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4635,lancelBut her demands?
4636,"tyrionOh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4637,lancelYou will?
4638,"tyrionYes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
4639,davosYour Grace.
4640,stannisDo your knuckle bones bring you luck?
4641,"davosWell, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4642,stannisFewer.
4643,davosPardon?
4644,stannisFour fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4645,davosIt reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4646,"stannisYou were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4647,davosA lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4648,stannisDoes he listen?
4649,"davosTo me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4650,stannisShe has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4651,davosI've lived within the law for seventeen-
4652,stannisI want you to be a smuggler this time.
4653,"davosAny shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4654,stannisThe Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4655,"davosI am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4656,stannisCleaner ways don't win wars.
4657,"melisandreAre you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4658,davosSomeone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4659,"melisandreYou've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4660,"davosI'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4661,"melisandreIf half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4662,davosAnd which are you?
4663,"melisandreOh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4664,"davosWell, that must be very nice for you."
4665,melisandreDo you love your wife?
4666,davosI do.
4667,melisandreYet you have known other women.
4668,davosDon't talk about my wife.
4669,"melisandreI'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4670,melisandreAnd you will.
4671,davosStrange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4672,"melisandreShadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4673,davosThese weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4674,melisandreThey can't bar our passage.
4675,davosGods protect us.
4676,"melisandreThere's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4677,renlyYou swear it?
4678,catelynBy the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4679,"renlyThen I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4680,catelynAnd the wording of this oath?
4681,"renlyThe same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4682,catelynAnd in return for my son's loyalty?
4683,"renlyIn the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4684,"renlyWhen that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4685,"catelynOur two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4686,renlyNegotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4687,renlyPlease bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4688,brienneNo! No.
4689,soldierFollow me!
4690,soldierYou'll die for this.
4691,"catelynNo, wait, it wasn't her!"
4692,catelynWe've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4693,manInside the king's tent - go
4694,manNow.
4695,brienneI won't leave him.
4696,catelynYou can't avenge him if you're dead.
4697,"manOver there, go!"
4698,brienneNot that way.
4699,margaeryWe need to go home. Loras.
4700,"petyrMy lord, my lady."
4701,lorasGet out.
4702,"petyrStannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4703,lorasAnd you want that privilege for yourself.
4704,"petyrYou will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4705,margaeryThere's no time for this.
4706,"lorasRide back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4707,margaeryBrienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4708,lorasI don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4709,petyrStannis.
4710,lorasI will put a sword through his righteous face.
4711,margaeryYou can't stay here.
4712,"lorasHe would have been a true king, a good king."
4713,"petyrTell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
4714,lorasRevenge.
4715,"petyrI have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4716,margaeryYou can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4717,margaeryHe was very handsome.
4718,"petyrHe was, Your Grace."
4719,"margaeryYour Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4720,petyrDo you want to be a queen?
4721,margaeryNo. I want to be the queen.
4722,cerseiKilled? By whom?
4723,tyrionAccounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4724,cerseiReally? Who'd have thought?
4725,"tyrionSome say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4726,"cerseiWhomever did it, I say well done."
4727,"tyrionIt's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4728,cerseiLittlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4729,"tyrionAnd I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
4730,"cerseiAren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
4731,tyrionShe'll be safer in Dorne.
4732,"cerseiYes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
4733,"tyrionIt so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
4734,cerseiSo clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
4735,tyrionSchemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
4736,cerseiNo need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
4737,tyrionMay I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
4738,"cerseiYou may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
4739,tyrionIt's important that we talk about this.
4740,cerseiIt's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
4741,lancelIt's wildfire.
4742,"tyrionWildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
4743,lancelNo.
4744,tyrionMThat's a lie right there.
4745,lancelIt is not a lie. Why would I lie?
4746,"tyrionTell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
4747,lancelI'm telling you the truth.
4748,tyrionThe smart money would be on more likely.
4749,lancelShe's making wildfire.
4750,tyrionBut then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
4751,lancelThe Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
4752,tyrionI suppose there's only one way to find out.
4753,lancelThey have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
4754,tyrionWhen did she tell you this?
4755,"lancelI heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
4756,tyrionSwear to me on what?
4757,lancelOn my life.
4758,tyrionBut I don't care about your life.
4759,"lancelIn the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
4760,"tyrionAll right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
4761,"tyrionOh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
4762,lancelPlease kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
4763,bronnIt will be my pleasure.
4764,davosYour Grace.
4765,stannisWhat is it?
4766,"davosI'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
4767,"stannisFools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
4768,davosI need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
4769,stannisI thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
4770,"davosYour Grace, I-"
4771,stannisI've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
4772,davosAnd I've never known you to hide from the truth.
4773,stannisYou've come to lecture me on truth?
4774,davosI've come to tell you that what I saw.
4775,"stannisAll my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
4776,"davosNothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
4777,stannisI'll hear no more about it.
4778,"manTake a company of men, secure the perimeter."
4779,davosWhen do we sail for King's Landing?
4780,"stannisAs soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
4781,davosAnd will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
4782,stannisThat's not your concern.
4783,"davosIf you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
4784,stannisI never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
4785,davosLoyal service means telling hard truths.
4786,"stannisOh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
4787,davosShe's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
4788,stannisWhat do you believe?
4789,davosYou won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
4790,stannisWe set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
4791,"davosYour Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
4792,"stannisMost of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
4793,girlI've got it! I've got it!
4794,"manSo it's that one there at the top, on the right."
4795,"manBuy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
4796,"tyrionStannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
4797,bronnThere's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
4798,"tyrionWell, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
4799,bronnGood thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
4800,"tyrionHe hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
4801,protesterCorruption.
4802,crowdYes!
4803,"protesterWe are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
4804,tyrionIt's hard to argue with his assessment.
4805,bronnNot after what he did to your birthday present.
4806,tyrionThe king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
4807,"manA dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
4808,tyrionYou have to admire his imagination.
4809,bronnHe's talking about you.
4810,tyrionWhat? Demon monkey?
4811,bronnPeople think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
4812,tyrionBlame me? I'm trying to save them.
4813,bronnYou don't need to convince me.
4814,tyrionDemon monkey.
4815,"manYeah, come on."
4816,theonYou're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
4817,theonStop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
4818,"blackWhere are we headed, Captain?"
4819,"theonThe Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
4820,blackAnd who decides if we've done our jobs well?
4821,theonI do. Your captain.
4822,"blackI have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
4823,"theonYou could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
4824,yaraStop. We yield.
4825,yaraCongratulations on your first command.
4826,theonThank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
4827,"yaraOh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
4828,theonYou'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
4829,"yaraThat would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
4830,"dagmerCome on, I'll take you out."
4831,theonWho are you?
4832,"dagmerDagmer, your first mate."
4833,theonWhy aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
4834,dagmerThey're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
4835,theonAnd how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
4836,dagmerYou're not.
4837,theonAnd yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
4838,dagmerThey're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
4839,theonThe Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
4840,"dagmerThe seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
4841,"theonNo, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
4842,theonTake me to my ship.
4843,"reginaldThe Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
4844,tywinThe Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
4845,amoryOur spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
4846,"tywinAnd I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
4847,"reginaldWe've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
4848,"tywinYes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
4849,reginaldMy wife's in Lannisport.
4850,"tywinWell, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
4851,"tywinIf your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
4852,"tywinNot wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
4853,"aryaMaidenpool, my lord."
4854,tywinAnd who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
4855,"aryaHouse Mooton, my lord."
4856,tywinAnd what is their sigil?
4857,"tywinA red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
4858,"tywinGood. One more time, where are you from?"
4859,"aryaBarrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
4860,tywinAnd what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
4861,aryaThey call him the Young Wolf.
4862,tywinAnd?
4863,aryaThey say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
4864,tywinAnd do you believe them?
4865,"aryaNo, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
4866,tywinFetch that water.
4867,jaqenA girl says nothing.
4868,"jaqenA girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
4869,aryaI was always a girl.
4870,jaqenAnd I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
4871,aryaYou're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
4872,jaqenAnd you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
4873,aryaI didn't have a choice.
4874,jaqenYou did. I did. And here we are.
4875,jaqenA man pays his debts. A man owes three.
4876,aryaThree what?
4877,"jaqenThe Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
4878,aryaI can name anyone and you'll kill him?
4879,jaqenA man has said.
4880,aryaThe one who tortures everyone.
4881,jaqenA man needs a name.
4882,aryaI don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
4883,"jaqenThat is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
4884,"jeorHe's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
4885,jonWhen will he come?
4886,jeorThe Halfhand does things in his own time.
4887,jonMy uncle told me stories about him.
4888,jeorMost of them are true.
4889,jonI heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
4890,jeorThe whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
4891,jonSo it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
4892,"jeorWell, possible for the Halfhand."
4893,"samBeautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
4894,dolorousThere's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
4895,manAbout time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
4896,"samThe Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
4897,"dolorousBefore I die, please, stop talking."
4898,"samThousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
4899,dolorousStupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
4900,jonI think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
4901,grennWildlings?
4902,jonOne blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
4903,"dolorousSo you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
4904,"samAnd three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
4905,"grennBut if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
4906,samWell I read it in a book.
4907,dolorousI read it in a book.
4908,jonLook. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
4909,"dolorousEDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
4910,"hayleneTake care, my lord."
4911,"tyrionI remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
4912,"hayleneOh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
4913,"hayleneAfter the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
4914,tyrionMy companion takes issue.
4915,bronnIf I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
4916,hayleneOur order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
4917,bronnTo do what?
4918,hayleneThe jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
4919,tyrionHow much do you have?
4920,"bronnIf you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
4921,"hayleneMy lord, this man is insulting."
4922,"bronnI don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
4923,tyrionMy friend remains unconvinced.
4924,hayleneHe would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
4925,"bronnWell, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
4926,"hayleneWe have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
4927,bronnThis is a shit idea.
4928,"tyrionI'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
4929,daenerysDracarys. Dracarys.
4930,daenerysHe'll be able to feed himself from now on.
4931,"daenerysLet him sleep, Doreah."
4932,"doreahYes, Khaleesi."
4933,daenerysHe loves you.
4934,irriI rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
4935,"daenerysThank you, my friend."
4936,doreahDid you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
4937,irriIt is known.
4938,doreahAnd if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
4939,"daenerysThe last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
4940,irriMay he ride forever through the night lands.
4941,"daenerysXaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
4942,doreahYou would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
4943,"irriShe's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
4944,irriYou are their guest. It would be rude not to.
4945,womanAnd you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
4946,daenerysIt sounds wonderful.
4947,womanThe Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
4948,daenerysPlease excuse me for a moment.
4949,daenerysWhat are they doing?
4950,"jorahMalakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
4951,kovarroOr melt it. Very simple.
4952,daenerysWe are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
4953,"kovarroOf course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
4954,daenerysNot even when we leave.
4955,kovarroWhy not?
4956,daenerysOur host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
4957,daenerysMy brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
4958,jorahIt's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
4959,daenerysThat's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
4960,"pyattMother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
4961,pyattTake this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
4962,"pyattShould you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
4963,xaroMy apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
4964,daenerysWhat is the House of the Undying?
4965,"xaroIt is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
4966,quaitheYou watch over her.
4967,jorahDo I know you?
4968,quaitheI know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
4969,jorahWho are you?
4970,"quaitheI'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
4971,brienneIt looked like Stannis.
4972,catelynTo me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
4973,brienneIn the shape of Stannis.
4974,catelynWe should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
4975,"brienneWill you stay there long, my lady?"
4976,"catelynOnly long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
4977,brienneI never knew my mother.
4978,catelynI'm sorry.
4979,catelynMy own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
4980,brienneIt's a bloody business.
4981,catelynWhat comes after is even harder.
4982,"brienneOnce you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
4983,catelynYou mean to kill Stannis.
4984,brienneI swore a vow.
4985,catelynBut Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
4986,catelynI'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
4987,catelynRenly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
4988,brienneI only held him that once as he was dying.
4989,"catelynHe's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
4990,"brienneI do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
4991,"catelynWhen the time comes, I will not hold you back."
4992,"brienneThen I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
4993,catelynI vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
4994,"winterfellAnd it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
4995,branWe can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
4996,"winterfellMy wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
4997,"branStop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
4998,luwinGood.
4999,branHodor.
5000,hodorHodor.
5001,rodrikBran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
5002,luwinTorrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5003,rodrikMight be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5004,branWe have to help them.
5005,"rodrikMost of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
5006,luwinDo you need so many?
5007,"branIf we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
5008,"rodrikWon't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
5009,"branSo, what does it mean?"
5010,oshaAsk your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5011,branI did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5012,"oshaMust not mean anything, then."
5013,branYou're lying.
5014,"oshaYou might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5015,branYou know what it means.
5016,oshaI never said I didn't.
5017,branYou didn't give me an honest answer.
5018,oshaThat's not the same as being a liar.
5019,"branWell, it's not far off."
5020,"oshaSo, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5021,"oshaSomething bad? Tell me, boy."
5022,"branI dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5023,oshaThe sea is hundreds of miles away.
5024,branI know. It's just a stupid dream.
5025,oshaI've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5026,"branOsha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5027,oshaThey say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5028,qhorinThere.
5029,jeorWhere?
5030,qhorinOn that mountain.
5031,samI don't see very well.
5032,jonA fire.
5033,"qhorinThere's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5034,jeorHow many wildlings have joined him?
5035,"qhorinFrom what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5036,jonWhere?
5037,qhorinSomewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5038,jeorYou saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5039,"qhorinMance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5040,jeorWe need to get rid of those lookouts.
5041,"qhorinIt's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
5042,"jonLord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
5043,"qhorinI've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5044,jonI've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5045,qhorinHe's the one?
5046,jeorAye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5047,"qhorinCraster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5048,"samI could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
5049,"jeorWell, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
5050,"xaroSo, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
5051,daenerysHe's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5052,xaroUnlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5053,daenerysAnd what about what a woman wants?
5054,"xaroMuch more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5055,daenerysTo cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5056,xaroWhy?
5057,daenerysBecause I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5058,xaroYou want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5059,daenerysI want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5060,"xaroAh, a conqueror."
5061,daenerysAnd how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5062,"xaroNo. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5063,"daenerysSo you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5064,"daenerysWhat do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5065,xaroI will show you why.
5066,xaroThe door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5067,daenerysAnd behind the door?
5068,daenerysAnd it can all be mine?
5069,"xaroAll? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5070,daenerysAll I have to do?
5071,xaroIs marry me.
5072,daenerysThat was a romantic proposal.
5073,"xaroI've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5074,"xaroSee? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5075,jorahIf you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5076,daenerysThe Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5077,"jorahTo win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5078,daenerysThe usurper is dead.
5079,"daenerysThe Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5080,jorahAccording to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5081,daenerysThe time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5082,"jorahRich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5083,"daenerysAnd if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
5084,"jorahI know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
5085,daenerysDo not speak to me like I'm a child.
5086,jorahI only want-
5087,daenerysWhat do you want? Tell me.
5088,jorahTo see you on the Iron Throne.
5089,daenerysWhy?
5090,"jorahYou have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5091,"daenerysSo what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
5092,"jorahMake your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
5093,daenerysAnd how do I get the ship?
5094,jorahI'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
5095,daenerysI look forward to meeting him.
5096,jorahKhaleesi.
5097,aryaYou should stand sideface.
5098,gendrySideface?
5099,aryaSideways.
5100,gendryWhy?
5101,aryaSmaller target.
5102,gendryAm I fighting someone?
5103,aryaYou're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
5104,goldGuards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
5105,goldGo up the battlement.
5106,womanThat is strange.
5107,goldMove away. Stand back. He's dead.
5108,theonI've taken your castle.
5109,branTheon?
5110,theonIt's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
5111,branWhy?
5112,theonTo take the castle.
5113,branYou went with Robb.
5114,theonAnd he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
5115,branI don't know.
5116,theonFind the halfwit.
5117,theonMy men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
5118,theonSo you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
5119,branI won't.
5120,"theonYes, you will."
5121,branI won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
5122,"theonThe castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
5123,branTheon. Did you hate us the whole time?
5124,branI've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
5125,theonLouder. Say Prince Theon.
5126,branI've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
5127,"farlenAye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
5128,"branFarlen, you be silent."
5129,"theonListen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
5130,branAll of you should do as he commands.
5131,theonMy father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
5132,farlenBugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
5133,ironbornShut up!
5134,"theonIf you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
5135,luwinI am.
5136,theonI am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
5137,luwinMy lord.
5138,oshaMy Lord Greyjoy.
5139,theonI see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
5140,oshaYou were here the day I was taken.
5141,theonI'm the one who took you. What of it?
5142,oshaLet me serve you.
5143,"theonServe me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
5144,oshaIt was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
5145,theonSo you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
5146,oshaStep aside.
5147,"oshaIt's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
5148,theonYou'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
5149,blackGreyjoy!
5150,blackWe caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
5151,"theonSer Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
5152,rodrikIt grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
5153,theonThey are not my people.
5154,rodrikKing Robb thought of you as a brother.
5155,"theonMy brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
5156,"rodrikAye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5157,"theonAmong them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5158,rodrikIf he were alive to see this
5159,theonHe's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
5160,rodrikI should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
5161,"theonYou've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
5162,theonTake him to the cells. Lock him up
5163,dagmerMy prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
5164,theonI'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
5165,"dagmerNo, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
5166,"theonSer Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
5167,branNo! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
5168,theonThe old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
5169,luwinI urge you not to make a hasty decision.
5170,"theonHe disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
5171,"luwinHe is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
5172,theonYou'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
5173,dagmerCome.
5174,branNo! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
5175,rodrikHe who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
5176,branI'm begging you.
5177,rodrikCoward.
5178,branStop. Stop! Stop right now!
5179,"theonYou don't give commands anymore, little lord."
5180,"branPlease, stop this. Please stop him."
5181,"rodrikHush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
5182,"branYou said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
5183,"theonAny last words, old man?"
5184,"rodrikGods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
5185,"branTheon, please don't."
5186,rickonDo something!
5187,"branI'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
5188,"jonGhost, stay with us. Ghost!"
5189,qhorinThere goes your pet.
5190,jonHe's not a pet.
5191,"qhorinNo, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5192,jonGhost is different.
5193,"qhorinSo you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5194,jonI thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5195,qhorinI said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5196,jonWe could do the same.
5197,"qhorinNo, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5198,jonMy father always said I'm of the North.
5199,jonI wasn't joking.
5200,"qhorinLook around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5201,"qhorinNo, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5202,jonI'll gladly give my life.
5203,"qhorinI don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5204,jonI do.
5205,"qhorinYou're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
5206,tywinCan you read?
5207,amoryMy lord?
5208,tywinThis letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
5209,"amoryMy apologies, my lord. I must have-"
5210,"tywinGirl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
5211,tywinMy cupbearer can read better than you.
5212,tywinTo whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
5213,"armoryMy lord, I-"
5214,"tywinTo the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5215,"tywinPut the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
5216,guardLord Petyr Baelish.
5217,tywinMmm. Give us the room.
5218,tywinClear all this.
5219,petyrLord Tywin.
5220,tywinBaelish.
5221,tywinWine?
5222,petyrThank you.
5223,tywinWhat news from the capital?
5224,petyrI traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5225,"tywinAh, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5226,petyrSo they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5227,tywinHere. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5228,petyrIt is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5229,"tywinYou say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5230,"petyrAfter the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5231,"tywinYes, yes, yes."
5232,petyrThe Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5233,tywinWants to be queen.
5234,"petyrYes, she does."
5235,tywinHouse Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5236,"petyrThey did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5237,tywinMore wine for Lord Baelish.
5238,"petyrIf you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
5239,petyrThey have.
5240,"aryaPardon, my lord."
5241,petyrIt's only wine.
5242,tywinYou would ride there yourself?
5243,"petyrTonight, with your leave."
5244,"tywinI'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
5245,tywinAnd what else?
5246,"petyrOn your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
5247,tywinWhy?
5248,petyrHe had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
5249,tywinHmm.
5250,jonA girl.
5251,qhorinA wildling.
5252,jonWe could question her.
5253,qhorinYou could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
5254,jonWhat's your name?
5255,ygritteYgritte.
5256,"qhorinShe was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
5257,ygritteI gave you my name.
5258,jonI'm Jon Snow.
5259,ygritteYou ought to burn them you killed.
5260,"qhorinWe'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
5261,ygritteBurn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
5262,qhorinOur boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
5263,ygritteThe Free Folk.
5264,qhorinHow many?
5265,"ygritteHundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
5266,qhorinWhy come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
5267,qhorinDo you mean to march on the Wall?
5268,"qhorinDo you know who I am, girl?"
5269,ygritteQhorin Halfhand.
5270,"qhorinTell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?"
5271,"ygritteThey'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
5272,qhorinWe have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
5273,"jonNo. No, I'll do it."
5274,"qhorinCome, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now."
5275,"ygritteYou never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
5276,jonI'm as much a crow as they are.
5277,ygritteWill you burn me? After?
5278,jonCan't. Someone might see the smoke.
5279,"ygritteStrike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
5280,ygritteGo on. Be quick about it.
5281,"ygritteDo it. Bastard, do it!"
5282,ygritteYou can't do it. We both know it.
5283,"ygritteThe sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
5284,jonI'll find them.
5285,ygritteCall for them. Go on. Call loudly.
5286,septonMay the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
5287,"cerseiOne day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
5288,joffreyYou sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
5289,sansaI saw you cry.
5290,"joffreyDid you say something, my lady?"
5291,sansaMy little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
5292,joffreySo?
5293,sansaIt seems a normal thing.
5294,joffreyIs your little brother a prince?
5295,sansaNo.
5296,"joffreyNot really relevant then, is it? Come, dog."
5297,"manHail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."
5298,manMurderer! Bastard!
5299,manAll hail the King.
5300,manHe's no king.
5301,manHe's a bastard!
5302,"manPlease, Your Grace, we're hungry."
5303,manFreak.
5304,tyrionGet the Prince back to the Keep now.
5305,"guardYes, my lord. Come, quickly."
5306,"womanPlease, Your Grace, give us some food!"
5307,"manBread, Your Grace, please!"
5308,joffreyWho threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!
5309,guardHold on!
5310,guardHold them back!
5311,joffreyJust kill them! Kill them all!
5312,tyrionMove. Move!
5313,guardPull back!
5314,manTear him to pieces!
5315,joffreyWhat are you doing? I want these people executed!
5316,sandorAnd they want the same for you.
5317,tyrionWhere's Sansa?
5318,guardThrough the door.
5319,guardCome on.
5320,guardPush hard.
5321,merynProtect the king!
5322,guardGet back!
5323,guardFall back! Keep him safe!
5324,guardCome in! Come in!
5325,cuardKeep him safe!
5326,crowdMotherfucker! Brotherfucker!
5327,guardWatch out. Hold them back.
5328,manHey.
5329,joffreyTraitors! I'll have all their heads.
5330,"tyrionOh, you blind, bloody fool!"
5331,joffreyYou can't insult me.
5332,"tyrionWe've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
5333,joffreyYou can't-
5334,"tyrionI can, I am."
5335,joffreyThey attacked me!
5336,"tyrionThey threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
5337,joffreyYou're talking to a king!
5338,tyrionAnd now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
5339,joffreyLet them have her!
5340,"tyrionIf she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
5341,manWhere are you going?
5342,"manYou ever been fucked, little girl? Come here."
5343,tyrionTake some men and go and find the Stark girl.
5344,merynI take my orders from the king.
5345,manWhere? This way.
5346,sansaPlease! No! No!
5347,manPlease!
5348,"sandorYou're all right now, little bird. You're all right."
5349,manWe'll get you.
5350,manThis way.
5351,"tyrionAre you hurt, my lady?"
5352,sandorThe little birdo s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
5353,"tyrionWell done, Clegane."
5354,sandorI didn't do it for you.
5355,daenerysHe shouldn't make me wait.
5356,"xaroThe Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth."
5357,daenerysI already have a husband.
5358,"xaroKhal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
5359,daenerysAnd you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
5360,"xaroI have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."
5361,spiceThe Mother of Dragons!
5362,"xaroAh, here he comes."
5363,"spiceForgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
5364,"xaroVery true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
5365,"spiceEvery lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
5366,"daenerysThank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
5367,"spiceOh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
5368,daenerysMy birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
5369,spiceI fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
5370,daenerysI'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
5371,"spiceI need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
5372,daenerysWhatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
5373,spiceRetake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
5374,"daenerysMy father sat there, before he was murdered."
5375,"spiceBut if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
5376,daenerysI didn't come here to argue grammar.
5377,"spiceOf course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
5378,daenerysNot yet.
5379,spiceYou do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
5380,daenerysThere are many there that support my claim.
5381,spiceWhen were you there last?
5382,daenerysI left when I was a baby.
5383,"spiceSo, in truth, you have no allies."
5384,daenerysThe people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
5385,"spiceAh. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
5386,"daenerysDo you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
5387,spiceA shrewd man.
5388,"daenerysFor my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
5389,daenerysDo you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
5390,"spiceI admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
5391,"daenerysI am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
5392,"spiceYes, my lady, but not with my ships."
5393,tywinWho taught you to read?
5394,"aryaMy father, my lord."
5395,"tywinHmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
5396,aryaA stonemason.
5397,tywinA stonemason who could read? Hmm.
5398,aryaHe taught himself.
5399,tywinQuite a man. What killed him?
5400,aryaLoyalty.
5401,"tywinYou're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
5402,"aryaDid... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
5403,tywinNo. But you've already begun.
5404,"aryaDid you know your father, my lord?"
5405,tywinI did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
5406,"tywinHe loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
5407,"aryaI'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
5408,tywinMmm.
5409,"amoryWhere are you going, girl?"
5410,"aryaThe armory, my lord."
5411,amoryWhy?
5412,aryaLord Tywin sent me.
5413,amoryWhat might this be?
5414,aryaLord Tywin gave it to me.
5415,amoryWhat for?
5416,aryaTo take to the armory.
5417,amoryWhy would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
5418,amoryMove! Get out of the way!
5419,aryaAmory Lorch.
5420,jaqenA girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
5421,aryaNow!
5422,jaqenA girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
5423,aryaBut he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
5424,tywinGuard!
5425,soldierYour Grace.
5426,"soldierMy honor, Your Grace."
5427,quentYour Grace.
5428,robbQuent.
5429,robbLady Talisa.
5430,talisaYour Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
5431,"robbIt's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
5432,talisaWhy are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
5433,robbBecause it's obvious.
5434,"talisaWhat if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"
5435,robbI'd call you a liar.
5436,talisaNot very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
5437,talisaI always thought I was a brilliant liar.
5438,"robbBetter at amputations, I'm afraid."
5439,robbQuite a pretty spot.
5440,talisaWill we be here long?
5441,robbI couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
5442,talisaI'm not a spy.
5443,"robbOf course, a spy would deny being a spy."
5444,"talisaYou're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The Young Wolf is on the move. """
5445,"robbPerhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
5446,catelynRobb.
5447,"robbMother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
5448,catelynLady Talisa.
5449,talisaLady Stark.
5450,catelynLady Talisa...?
5451,talisaMaegyr.
5452,"catelynMaegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
5453,"talisaAn uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
5454,robbI've missed you.
5455,"catelynYes, you look positively forlorn."
5456,"robbYou surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
5457,catelynI wish that you were free to follow your heart.
5458,robbI know.
5459,catelynYou have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
5460,catelynA debt that must be paid.
5461,robbI haven't forgotten.
5462,rooseYour Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
5463,ygritteYour brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
5464,jonWe'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
5465,ygritteHere? There's no shelter here.
5466,jonThere's no shelter anywhere.
5467,ygritteThere is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
5468,jonNo fire.
5469,ygritteBut a fire is-
5470,ygritteHave it your way.
5471,ygritteWe'll stay warmer if we stay close.
5472,ygritteBet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
5473,ygritteThink they're out looking for you?
5474,jonYes.
5475,ygritteThink they'll find you?
5476,"ygritteYou're brave. Stupid, but brave."
5477,jonWe start again at first light. Get some sleep.
5478,jonStop moving.
5479,ygritteI'm just trying to get comfortable.
5480,jonStop it!
5481,jonYou're still moving.
5482,ygritteWas I? I didn't notice that time.
5483,robbThis cannot be true.
5484,"rooseWe've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
5485,robbWhy? Why would Theon-
5486,rooseBecause the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
5487,robbMy brothers?
5488,rooseWe've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
5489,"catelynI told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
5490,robbI must go north at once.
5491,"rooseThere's still a war to win, Your Grace."
5492,robbHow can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
5493,rooseYou are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
5494,catelynLet me go and talk to Theon.
5495,robbThere will be no talk. He will die for this.
5496,"rooseTheon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
5497,"robbTell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
5498,theonWhy on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
5499,oshaI'm no liar.
5500,theonAll wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
5501,"oshaI done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
5502,theonHow? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
5503,"oshaThere are other ways to serve, my lord."
5504,"theonI'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
5505,"ahsaThere are other ways to serve, my prince."
5506,theonLike what?
5507,"oshaWe know things, the free people."
5508,theonYou know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
5509,oshaOther things.
5510,oshaSavage things.
5511,theonWait outside.
5512,theonI always wondered what you had under there.
5513,oshaIt comes at a price.
5514,theonI'm not killing you. That's your price.
5515,oshaI already had that.
5516,"theonWhat do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5517,ahsaWhat all free people want. My freedom.
5518,"theonWell, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
5519,sansaOw!
5520,shaeShh. It's not deep.
5521,sansaI thought they were going to kill me.
5522,"shaeThey thought so, too."
5523,"sansaHe hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
5524,shaeOf course he did.
5525,sansaWhy? Why would a stranger-
5526,shaeYou are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5527,sansaI would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5528,shaeDon't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5529,sansaBut you're not the wrong people.
5530,shaeDon't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
5531,guardAnd where are you going?
5532,oshaI have something for you from Prince Theon.
5533,guardWhat?
5534,oshaMe. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5535,daenerysThe Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5536,"xaroWhen I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
5537,"xaroBar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
5538,daenerysWhere are they? Where are my dragons?
5539,"theonA cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
5540,blackThe giant must have took him.
5541,"theonThe giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
5542,"blackGone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
5543,theonRight. Get the horses and the hounds.
5544,"manCome on, find the scent. Where they going?"
5545,dagmerHalt!
5546,theonEnjoying your first hunt?
5547,"luwinSo far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
5548,"theonWith hunting, there's blood at the end."
5549,luwinThey're little boys.
5550,"theonI was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
5551,luwinThose boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
5552,theonThey have no value to me missing.
5553,luwinRobb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5554,"theonRobb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
5555,manWe have a scent!
5556,"theonThe hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
5557,oshaWe should have took more food.
5558,branWe couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
5559,oshaThose people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
5560,"branAnd if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
5561,oshaThe boy can't survive on walnuts.
5562,rickonI'm fine.
5563,oshaWe've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
5564,hodorHodor.
5565,"oshaEven you, sweet giant."
5566,"branWait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there."
5567,rickonJack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
5568,"branWe can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
5569,rikonBilly climbs a tree better than anyone.
5570,"oshaYou've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
5571,branThey'll be after us with hounds.
5572,"oshaWe got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
5573,ygritteDid you pull a knife on me in the night?
5574,ygritteWhat's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
5575,jonLet's move.
5576,"ygritteIt is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5577,jonI'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5578,ygritteYou're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
5579,jonDon't call them that.
5580,"ygritteWhat, stones? Or bone?"
5581,jonNeither. Both.
5582,jonMove!
5583,"ygritteI heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5584,"jonThere are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5585,ygritteSo the lads just do it with each other?
5586,jonNo.
5587,ygritteNever?
5588,jonNever. We swore an oath.
5589,"ygritteYou have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5590,jonWould you please shut up?
5591,"ygritteWould you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
5592,jonYou're a free woman?
5593,"ygritteI might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5594,"jonIf you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5595,ygritteAnd you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5596,jonIt was my choice to say the words.
5597,ygritteSo you don't like girls?
5598,jonOf course I like girls.
5599,ygritteBut you chose never to touch them.
5600,jonThat's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5601,"ygritteSo instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5602,"jonInvade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5603,ygritteThey're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5604,"jonMy father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5605,ygritteSo why are you fighting us?
5606,"manGo on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
5607,tywinWolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5608,mountianWe hanged twenty men last night.
5609,tywinI don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5610,mountainWe think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5611,"tywinPretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5612,"mountainKilling them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5613,"tywinBurn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
5614,tywinMmm. Is that mutton?
5615,"aryaYes, my lord."
5616,tywinDon't like mutton.
5617,aryaI'll bring something else.
5618,tywinLeave it. Are you hungry?
5619,aryaNo.
5620,tywinOf course you are. Eat.
5621,aryaI'll eat in the kitchen later.
5622,tywinIt's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
5623,tywinYou're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5624,aryaI eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5625,tywinMmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5626,aryaHave you ever lost before?
5627,tywinDo you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5628,"tywinBut this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5629,tywinDo you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5630,"tywinThe tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5631,aryaDragons?
5632,tywinYes. Dragons happened.
5633,"tywinHarrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5634,aryaAegon and his sisters.
5635,tywinMmm?
5636,"aryaIt wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5637,"tywinCorrect. A student of history, are you?"
5638,aryaRhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5639,tywinI'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5640,aryaVisenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5641,"tywinHmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5642,tywinAren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5643,aryaMost girls are idiots.
5644,tywinYou remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5645,aryaFrom my father.
5646,tywinHe was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
5647,"aryaHave you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
5648,"tywinCareful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
5649,"tywinAnd, girl."
5650,tywinM'lord.
5651,"tywinLowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
5652,"aryaMy mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
5653,tywinYou're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
5654,aryaYes.
5655,tywinGo on.
5656,"sansaI beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
5657,sandorBrave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
5658,sansaDoes it give you joy to scare people?
5659,"sandorNo, it gives me joy to kill people."
5660,sandorSpare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
5661,sansaIt was his duty. He never liked it.
5662,sandorIs that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
5663,sansaWhy are you always so hateful?
5664,sandorYou'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
5665,xaroI've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
5666,daenerysYou are one of the Thirteen.
5667,"xaroIf I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
5668,daenerysNothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
5669,xaroShall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
5670,"daenerysThere is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
5671,"xaroI took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
5672,daenerysBut it did happen under your roof.
5673,"xaroKhaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-"
5674,daenerysI don't care where you've been.
5675,"ygritteYou think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
5676,"jonNo. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
5677,"ygritteWe chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
5678,ygritteYou're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
5679,jonWalk.
5680,ygritteI could teach you how to do it.
5681,jonI know how to do it.
5682,"ygritteYou know nothing, Jon Snow."
5683,robbAnd what did she say?
5684,"altonShe admired your spirit, Your Grace."
5685,robbAnd what then?
5686,"altonShe, uh..."
5687,"robbIf every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
5688,"altonShe tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
5689,"robbYou've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
5690,"rickardSer Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork."
5691,rooseToo many prisoners.
5692,robbIs there room for Ser Alton?
5693,rickardDoes he need to lie down?
5694,robbHave the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
5695,rickardTorrhen.
5696,robbThat will be all.
5697,talisaYour Grace. A minute of your time?
5698,talisaI've been treating your wounded men.
5699,"robbAnd my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
5700,talisaThey're not my enemies.
5701,robbThat's what I tell my bannermen.
5702,"talisaI've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
5703,robbBut some are not.
5704,talisaI need silk for stitching.
5705,"talisaI need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."
5706,robbIf you need help finding these-
5707,"talisaI know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
5708,"robbContinue, my lady."
5709,talisaYou're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
5710,robbYes.
5711,talisaThe Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
5712,robbI expect he will.
5713,talisaIf I could write a list-
5714,robbCome with me to the Crag.
5715,talisaI don't think that will be-
5716,"robbLet the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
5717,"womanChildren, come inside, quick. Come on."
5718,childHurry up!
5719,"manCan't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent."
5720,theonTry again.
5721,manWe've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
5722,"luwinWe could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
5723,"theonI'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
5724,manPrince Theon.
5725,theonWhere are they?
5726,"winterfellWho, m'lord?"
5727,theonThe Stark boys. Where are they?
5728,winterfellI don't know. I seen no one.
5729,theonThink harder.
5730,"winterfellI swear, m'lord. I don't know."
5731,"dagmerMy lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for."
5732,dagmerSend the old man home.
5733,theonGo back to Winterfell. Take him back.
5734,"luwinTheon, don't do this."
5735,daenerysYou came back.
5736,jorahAs soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
5737,daenerysIrri is dead.
5738,jorahI know. She was a good-
5739,daenerysShe's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
5740,jorahDoreah?
5741,"daenerysWe can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
5742,jorahI should have been here.
5743,daenerysYou went to find me a ship.
5744,jorahMy place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
5745,"daenerysThese people""?"
5746,jorahThey are not to be trusted.
5747,"daenerysAnd who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
5748,jorahYour people are in Westeros.
5749,daenerysThe people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
5750,jorahThey will soon enough.
5751,daenerysAnd then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
5752,"jorahYou are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
5753,"daenerysThere it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
5754,jorahYou are too young to be so-
5755,daenerysAnd you are too familiar.
5756,"jorahForgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
5757,daenerysFind my dragons.
5758,ygritteHow long till we get back to your crows?
5759,jonWe're close.
5760,"ygritteWhat, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
5761,ygritteWhat do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
5762,jonNothing happened between you and me.
5763,"ygritteI swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"
5764,jonTurn back around.
5765,"ygritteAnd I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
5766,"jonWhat, right here in the muck?"
5767,ygritteI'll keep you warm enough.
5768,ygritteAre you that afraid of it?
5769,jonThat's enough.
5770,ygritteIt's nice and wet and warm.
5771,jonEnough!
5772,ygritteIt don't have teeth.
5773,"ygritteAll right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
5774,ygritteShould have took me while you had the chance.
5775,"sansaNo, no!"
5776,"sansaNo. Oh, no."
5777,shaeIt's all right. Give me that.
5778,"sansaIf the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
5779,shaeHelp me flip it over.
5780,shaeWhere are you going?
5781,handmaidenTo tell Her Grace.
5782,shaeYou'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
5783,"cerseiYour mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
5784,"sansaMy mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
5785,cerseiIn what way?
5786,sansaI thought it would be less messy.
5787,cerseiWait until you birth a child.
5788,cerseiYou're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
5789,sansaI'm fit to bear children for the king?
5790,"cerseiA prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
5791,"cerseiJoffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
5792,sansaHis Grace was not with you?
5793,"cerseiRobert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
5794,"cerseiYou may never love the king, but you will love his children."
5795,sansaI love His Grace with all my heart.
5796,"cerseiThat's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
5797,"sansaBut shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
5798,"cerseiYou can try, little dove."
5799,jaimeWho did you say your mother was again?
5800,altonCinda Lannister.
5801,jaimeIs she the fat one?
5802,"altonWell, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
5803,"jaimeNo, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
5804,"altonI squired for you once, you know."
5805,jaimeWhen?
5806,"altonThe tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
5807,jaimeI went to Willem Frey's wedding?
5808,altonYou did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
5809,jaimeHe threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
5810,altonBryan.
5811,"jaimePoor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
5812,"altonThat's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
5813,"jaimeYou didn't, though."
5814,altonYou really remember?
5815,"jaimeYou knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
5816,altonWhen I think back to that day-
5817,guardShh!
5818,jaimeYou were saying?
5819,altonI- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
5820,jaimeMore embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
5821,"altonI remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
5822,jaimeI understand completely.
5823,"altonHow could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
5824,"jaimeIt's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
5825,altonWhich knight was it?
5826,jaimeBarristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
5827,altonWhat was he like?
5828,"jaimeHe was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
5829,altonIt's hard to put into words.
5830,"jaimeIt's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
5831,altonLeaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
5832,altonDid you squire for him again?
5833,"jaimeNo. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
5834,"jaimeIt's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
5835,altonAnd have you thought about
5836,jaimeOf course. Every day.
5837,altonAnd?
5838,"jaimeGood prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
5839,"jaimeBut there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
5840,altonWhat is it?
5841,jaimeIt's actually quite simple.
5842,"altonWell, let me help you."
5843,jaimeYou'll only have to do one thing.
5844,altonTell me.
5845,jaimeYou'll have to die.
5846,quaithJorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
5847,jorahI didn't come here for lessons.
5848,"quaithNo, you came for the dragons."
5849,jorahYou have them? Where are they?
5850,quaithDraw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
5851,quaithYou love her.
5852,jorahWhere are the dragons?
5853,"quaithWill you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
5854,quaithWill you betray her again?
5855,jorahNever.
5856,quaithThe thief you seek is with her now.
5857,spiceI did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
5858,xaroNo one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
5859,"daenerysPlease, they're my children. I'm begging you."
5860,silkBegging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
5861,"daenerysWithout me, the dragons will die."
5862,"spiceIt will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
5863,"pyatYou are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi."
5864,daenerysHow?
5865,pyattI will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
5866,daenerysYou have my dragons?
5867,"pyatWhen I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
5868,daenerysBut there is no King of Qarth.
5869,xaroThere is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
5870,"xaroYou would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."
5871,"spiceYour ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."
5872,"xaroAn upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
5873,"pyatThe Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
5874,pyattpreeA mother should be with her children.
5875,"pyatWhere will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them."
5876,jacksLady Stark!
5877,brienneNo farther.
5878,"jacksKeep your hands off me, woman."
5879,"brienneDon't enter without an invitation, man."
5880,jacksForgive me. Lady Stark.
5881,catelynWhat is it?
5882,jacksThey caught the Kingslayer.
5883,manKingslayer!
5884,manKill the fucking Kingslayer!
5885,manHang him!
5886,manYou'll die today.
5887,manJustice for the Karstark.
5888,manGut him!
5889,rickardGet back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
5890,"catelynLord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
5891,rickardThis monster killed my son.
5892,"catelynAnd crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
5893,rickardI will have his head. And if you try and stop me
5894,"catelynYou will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
5895,rickardAnd where is our king now?
5896,robbYou know very well.
5897,"rickardHe has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him."
5898,catelynHow dare you!
5899,brienneThreatening my lady is an act of treason.
5900,rickardTreason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
5901,"catelynI understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
5902,"rickardWhen your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
5903,catelynWise men do not make demands of kings.
5904,rickardFathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
5905,"jaimeThank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
5906,catelynTake him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
5907,jaimeYou've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
5908,catelynAnd gag him!
5909,tyrionSince when do you light your own candles?
5910,cerseiSince I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
5911,cerseiHow many times can you read one raven scroll?
5912,"tyrionStannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
5913,cerseiMore than we have.
5914,"tyrionYes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
5915,"cerseiWe have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
5916,"tyrionRain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
5917,"cerseiWhy not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
5918,"tyrionCall it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
5919,cerseiI'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
5920,tyrionHe needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
5921,cerseiI'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
5922,tyrionI thought the girls might help him.
5923,cerseiDid you?
5924,tyrionI was wrong. If we can't control him
5925,cerseiDo you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
5926,tyrionIt's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
5927,cerseiI always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
5928,tyrionThe boy is more Robert than Jaime.
5929,"cerseiRobert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
5930,tyrionSins?
5931,"cerseiThe Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
5932,"tyrionYou've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
5933,manThen why wait?
5934,manWe're sworn to the king.
5935,manThere's not a king.
5936,manThat's treason.
5937,"manSo is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
5938,"manBack off, you."
5939,"manNo, I won't."
5940,"brienneYour son returns at dawn, my lady?"
5941,catelynSo they say.
5942,"brienneThe Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
5943,catelynCome.
5944,catelynI need to be alone with him.
5945,"guardMy lady, our orders-"
5946,"catelynYour orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
5947,"jaimeCome to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
5948,catelynDo you hear them out there? They want your head.
5949,jaimeOld Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
5950,catelynYou strangled his son with your chains.
5951,jaimeOh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
5952,catelynYou are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
5953,"jaimeSo many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
5954,"catelynShe is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
5955,"jaimeKingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
5956,catelynYou are a man without honor.
5957,"jaimeDo you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
5958,catelynBrienne.
5959,"jaimeNo, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
5960,catelynYour sword.
5961,theonI told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
5962,luwinWhat are you doing? What have you done?
5963,"theonIf there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
5964,luwinNo!
5965,manRiders approaching!
5966,marOpen the gate!
5967,"yaraWhy, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
5968,theonEnvy isn't attractive.
5969,yaraWhat envy?
5970,theonYou should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
5971,"yaraYou're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
5972,"theonI treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
5973,yaraYou treated them with honor? By butchering them?
5974,theonBefore I had to kill them- I treated them-
5975,"yaraYou seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
5976,theonExactly.
5977,yaraThen you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
5978,theonThey made me a promise
5979,yaraYour little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
5980,theonDon't call me
5981,yaraA cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
5982,"theonIf I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
5983,yaraYou are weak. And you're stupid.
5984,theonI'm warning you.
5985,"yaraGo on, then. Warn me."
5986,theonYou haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
5987,yaraYou're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
5988,theonIs this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
5989,"yaraAye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
5990,theonHe won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
5991,yaraLeave us.
5992,"yaraTheon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
5993,theonI don't intend to die.
5994,"yaraYou were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
5995,"ygritteI've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
5996,lordI already got one crow. Don't need two.
5997,ygritteMance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
5998,lordThe Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
5999,ygritteHe could have killed me half a dozen times.
6000,lordAnd now he wishes he did. Gut him.
6001,"ygritteHe's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
6002,ygritteMance will want him.
6003,lordWhat does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
6004,ygritteI don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6005,"lordHe runs, I'll chop his balls off."
6006,"ygritteHe runs, I'll do it meself."
6007,"ygritteWe're even now, Jon Snow."
6008,"jonI couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
6009,qhorinI know.
6010,jonThe others?
6011,"qhorinWhen you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
6012,jonThey died because of me.
6013,qhorinSee that it wasn't for nothing.
6014,"wildlingAll right, up, lad."
6015,"wildlingCome on, on your feet, now. Move it."
6016,talisaIs she beautiful?
6017,robbI've never met her.
6018,talisaWhat's her name?
6019,"robbFrey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
6020,talisaI'm sure you'll be very happy.
6021,talisaAnd you're marrying her for a bridge?
6022,robbAn important bridge.
6023,talisaAh.
6024,"robbIt was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
6025,"talisaWhen I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
6026,"robbHe was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6027,"talisaChildren do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6028,"robbHe once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6029,talisaI wish I could have met him.
6030,robbHe would have liked you.
6031,talisaMost lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6032,robbHe didn't care much about gold or glory.
6033,talisaAnd you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6034,talisaThen why don't you?
6035,robbBecause we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6036,"talisaChopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6037,robbThat would be a start.
6038,"riderYour Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
6039,robbHow? How?
6040,robbTell me this isn't true.
6041,robbWhy?
6042,catelynFor the girls.
6043,robbYou betrayed me.
6044,catelynRobb-
6045,robbNo! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
6046,"catelynBran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
6047,"rickardI lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
6048,"catelynI grieve for your sons, my lord."
6049,rickardI don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6050,"catelynKilling Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6051,robbJaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6052,catelynRobb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
6053,"soldierForty, Your Grace."
6054,robbSend another forty with our fastest horses.
6055,catelynRobb.
6056,jaimeDamn.
6057,"jaimeYou're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
6058,jaimeA captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
6059,brienneBrienne of Tarth.
6060,"jaimeTarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
6061,jaimeHave you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
6062,"jaimeI didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
6063,"brienneYour crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
6064,jaimeWhy do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
6065,"brienneYou've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
6066,jaimeHas anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
6067,brienneYou will not provoke me to anger.
6068,jaimeI already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
6069,brienneI've never seen you fight.
6070,jaimeThe answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
6071,brienneAll my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
6072,"jaimeIf you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
6073,brienneDo you take me for an idiot? In!
6074,"jaimeI took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
6075,"brienneMaybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
6076,kevanKing's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
6077,tywinSurrender the Iron Throne?
6078,kevanBetter than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
6079,"tywinNo, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
6080,kevanThe scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
6081,"tywinHa! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
6082,tywinToo close to Casterly Rock.
6083,kevanHe sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
6084,tywinHe's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
6085,"tywinWe'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
6086,guardYou've got some questions to answer.
6087,manWho killed Ser Amory?
6088,manI don't know! Please!
6089,manGive me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
6090,"manI told you, I don't know. Please."
6091,"rorgeLook, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
6092,aryaWhere's Jaqen?
6093,"rorgeDon't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
6094,"guardCome on, time to kill some wolves."
6095,"hotYou need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
6096,hotHow would I know?
6097,aryaI need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
6098,gendryYou need him?
6099,aryaHe's helping me.
6100,hotI saw him.
6101,aryaWhere?
6102,hotOw!
6103,hotThey went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
6104,hotOn patrol. Let go of my ears.
6105,hotWhat do you want with him anyway?
6106,"quorinMance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
6107,jonThey'll never trust me.
6108,quorinThey might. If you do what needs to be done.
6109,jonWhat?
6110,quorinHow does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
6111,jonI didn't.
6112,"quorinI should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
6113,"lordHe's not yours to kill, crow."
6114,tyrionDo you have to do that here?
6115,bronnI like to keep me hands clean.
6116,"tyrionYes, but do you have to do it here?"
6117,tyrionYou should start wearing the gold cloak.
6118,bronnI don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6119,tyrionYou're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6120,"bronnA cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6121,"tyrionWell, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6122,bronnWe had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6123,"tyrionFine, fine. No gold cloak."
6124,tyrionWhat?
6125,bronnWhat?
6126,tyrionWhat? What? Why are you staring at me?
6127,bronnYou don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6128,tyrionTo help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6129,tyrionStannis will be here any day.
6130,bronnAnd one of these explains how to beat him?
6131,"tyrionAn History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6132,bronnChevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6133,varysMy Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6134,tyrionI did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6135,bronnMe and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6136,tyrionFor questioning?
6137,bronnNo. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6138,tyrionWe talked about this.
6139,"bronnAye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6140,"bronnThe thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6141,"varysGiven the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6142,"varysAh. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6143,"tyrionStannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6144,"varysAnd if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6145,bronnWe could throw books at his men.
6146,varysWe don't have that many books.
6147,"bronnWe don't have that many men, either."
6148,varysWhat do we have?
6149,tyrionPig shit.
6150,samI'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6151,dolorousI always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6152,grennWe're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6153,dolorousYou lack imagination.
6154,samWhere do you think Jon is right now?
6155,dolorousHe went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6156,"samHe's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6157,"grennWell, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6158,samHe's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6159,eddisionSo did his father.
6160,samAnd Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6161,dolorousGreat rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6162,grennWhat in seven hells is that?
6163,samThe First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6164,grennLook.
6165,"dolorousIf you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6166,samThat's a Night's Watch cloak.
6167,grennIt's been here a long time.
6168,samOh. Must be dragonglass.
6169,grennDragonglass?
6170,samThe maesters call it obsidian.
6171,grennWhy would a brother hide it here?
6172,dolorousI expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6173,soldierMind where you're going.
6174,aryaI'm sorry. I'll-
6175,aryaWhere were you?
6176,jaqenA man has patrol duty.
6177,"aryaTywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6178,jaqenA girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6179,aryaHow long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6180,"jaqenA minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6181,aryaHe's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6182,jaqenThis a man cannot do.
6183,aryaYou promised you'd help me.
6184,"jaqenHelp was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6185,aryaAnd you'll kill them? Anybody?
6186,"jaqenBy the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6187,aryaAll right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6188,jaqenA girl gives a man his own name?
6189,aryaThat's right.
6190,jaqenGods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6191,aryaI'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6192,jaqenUn-name me.
6193,aryaNo.
6194,jaqenPlease?
6195,aryaI'll un-name you.
6196,jaqenThank you.
6197,aryaIf you help me and my friends escape.
6198,jaqenThis would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6199,"aryaFine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6200,"jaqenA girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6201,aryaA girl will obey.
6202,jaqenA girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6203,"tyrionThank you, Podrick."
6204,cerseiOdd little boy.
6205,tyrionI have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6206,cerseiYou and Varys both.
6207,tyrionExcellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6208,cerseiHe's only a boy.
6209,tyrionYounger boys are off fighting his war.
6210,cerseiHe's not ready.
6211,"tyrionWhat is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6212,"cerseiBetter than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6213,"tyrionIt's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6214,cerseiDo you think I'm an idiot?
6215,"tyrionNo, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6216,cerseiYou shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6217,tyrionHe'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6218,cerseiDo you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6219,tyrionBecause he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6220,cerseiBecause he doesn't have a cock.
6221,tyrionNeither do you.
6222,"cerseiPerhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6223,tyrionIt's not that little.
6224,tyrionWhy are you smiling?
6225,cerseiBecause I'm happy.
6226,tyrionAnd why are you happy?
6227,cerseiBecause I have your little whore.
6228,tyrionI thought you preferred blondes.
6229,"cerseiSuch a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6230,tyrionWhy do you care who I fuck?
6231,"cerseiBecause a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6232,tyrionThis is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6233,"cerseiFor what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6234,tyrionWhere did you find her?
6235,"cerseiVarys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6236,tyrionYou've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6237,"cerseiOh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6238,"tyrionYou don't buy them, you only rent them."
6239,"cerseiYou're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6240,tyrionAnd how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6241,"cerseiWould you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6242,tyrionI'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6243,tyrionI promise I will free you.
6244,rosDon't forget me.
6245,tyrionNever.
6246,"tyrionI will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6247,cerseiGet out.
6248,tyrionShae!
6249,shaeI've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6250,tyrionYou're beautiful.
6251,shaeThen why do you look sad?
6252,tyrionWe have to be more careful.
6253,shaeDon't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6254,tyrionThere are people who want to hurt me.
6255,shaeI know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6256,tyrionI would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6257,shaeI'm yours.
6258,tyrionPromise me.
6259,shaeI'm yours and you are mine.
6260,robbStill no word?
6261,rooseWe've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6262,robbTheon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6263,rooseHe wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6264,robbSend word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6265,"rooseA touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6266,robbAny Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6267,rooseI expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6268,"talisaYour pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6269,rooseMy lady.
6270,talisaHow are you?
6271,robbHow am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6272,talisaI'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6273,robbNo. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6274,talisaYou have every right. You're a king.
6275,robbThat's not the kind of king I want to be.
6276,talisaWhat kind do you want to be?
6277,robbI don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6278,"talisaI was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6279,robbI'd like to hear you play the harp.
6280,"talisaNo. No, you would not."
6281,robbHow did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6282,"talisaWhen I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6283,robbI don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6284,talisaI don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
6285,hotThe sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
6286,gendryShut up.
6287,"hotProbably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."
6288,aryaShut up. What did you bring?
6289,yaraShut up. What did you bring?
6290,hotThe cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6291,gendryWhat did he want us to do about those guards?
6292,"aryaHe didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6293,gendryWhat about the guards?
6294,aryaHe didn't say anything about the guards.
6295,"gendryWhat, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6296,aryaWe have to trust him.
6297,gendryTrust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6298,hotI want to go back to the kitchens.
6299,aryaShut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
6300,"gendryArry, don't."
6301,manAway! Reset!
6302,"davosIf the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
6303,stannisWill it hold?
6304,"davosCan't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
6305,"manAgain, pull!"
6306,"stannisI admire you, Ser Davos."
6307,"davosI thank you, Your Grace."
6308,"stannisPleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6309,"davosMy son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6310,stannisDo you? Why?
6311,davosMy father was a crabber.
6312,stannisAnd?
6313,"davosWell, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6314,stannisAnd where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6315,davosMany fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6316,stannisYou defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6317,davosSome are happy to do it to my face.
6318,"stannisWe were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6319,"davosNo one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6320,stannisNo? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6321,davosHe was only a boy.
6322,stannisThen why'd he give him Storm's End?
6323,"stannisFirst, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6324,"davosAnd potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6325,stannisEvery man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6326,davosI was relieved they did not.
6327,"stannisRobert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6328,"davosYour Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6329,stannisI expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6330,joffreyYou're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6331,"varysNo man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6332,joffreyThe Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6333,"tyrionTo strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6334,"joffreyIf my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6335,"tyrionA brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6336,joffreyThey say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6337,tyrionImagine Stannis' terror.
6338,varysI am trying.
6339,tyrionYou're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6340,"varysOh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6341,"tyrionI wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6342,"varysI wish we could, too."
6343,tyrionWhat do you want? Tell me.
6344,"varysIf we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6345,"tyrionMy brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6346,varysA most highborn plumber.
6347,tyrionThe water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6348,"varysYou're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6349,tyrionI do. Last thing I expected.
6350,varysAnd you play it well.
6351,"tyrionI'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6352,varysThey say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6353,"tyrionThe Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6354,"varysIn the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6355,tyrionWe should sail there immediately.
6356,"varysThis morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6357,tyrionA girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6358,"varysShe has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6359,"tyrionOne game at a time, my friend."
6360,"jorahCareful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6361,daenerysAstapor?
6362,jorahWe cannot stay here.
6363,daenerysThey have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6364,"jorahThey're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6365,daenerysYou should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6366,"jorahYou know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6367,"daenerysThen serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6368,"jorahThat's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6369,daenerysAnd what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6370,"jorahUntil my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6371,daenerysThey are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6372,theonWe should bury them.
6373,dagmerI'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6374,"theonIf they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6375,dagmerWhat's this?
6376,theonGold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6377,dagmerHis troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6378,"dagmerHis wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6379,oshaGot as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6380,luwinYou're right so far.
6381,oshaWho was that out there hung up at the gates?
6382,luwinMust have been the farmer's boys.
6383,oshaHe killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6384,luwinThey mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6385,oshaThey'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6386,matthosThat's it. The tide's against us.
6387,"davosAye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6388,matthosYou're coming home.
6389,davosKing's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6390,"matthosThis is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6391,"davosOf course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6392,"matthosNot after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6393,davosGods be good.
6394,"matthosGod. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6395,davosBut not over them?
6396,"matthosOver all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6397,"davosWell, first, we have to put it there."
6398,matthosOur ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6399,"davosOur army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6400,matthosI have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6401,"shaeAre you afraid, my lion?"
6402,"tyrionIf the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6403,shaeI won't let them hurt you.
6404,tyrionI'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6405,shaeIt is now.
6406,tyrionYou can't fuck your way out of everything.
6407,shaeI have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6408,"pycelleAs you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6409,cerseiYour words are always wise and measured.
6410,"pycelleIf you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6411,cerseiYou brought me something?
6412,"pycelleYes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6413,cerseiI know what ten drops will bring.
6414,"pycelleYour Grace, if I may ask-"
6415,cerseiYou may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6416,pycelleYes. A siege is very-
6417,"cerseiBe careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6418,pycelleYour Grace.
6419,"menAnd so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
6420,bronnTo the boys!
6421,soldierLannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
6422,bronnDrunk Lannisters.
6423,prostituteYou've got a pretty voice.
6424,bronnThank you very much.
6425,prostituteAnd I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6426,"bronnWell, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6427,prostituteOh.
6428,bronnIt wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6429,"bronnSecond time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6430,"bronnEh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6431,prostitutePoor nose.
6432,bronnDon't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6433,"bronnWelcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
6434,bronnI don't think he likes me.
6435,sandorYou think you're a hard man?
6436,bronnI know it.
6437,bronnIt's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6438,"sandorOh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6439,sandorOnly smaller.
6440,bronnAnd quicker. Eh?
6441,sandorYour Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6442,bronnAye I expect he will someday.
6443,manHere we are.
6444,bronnOne more drink before the war? Shall we?
6445,"varysI've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6446,tyrionA wedding.
6447,"varysExactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6448,"tyrionIs that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6449,varysI'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6450,tyrionI'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6451,varysDo you trust him?
6452,"tyrionOddly enough, I do."
6453,varysGood.
6454,varysThe map you asked for.
6455,tyrionThere must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6456,varysCloser to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6457,"tyrionI'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6458,"varysThat is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6459,"tyrionWell, I'm not."
6460,"varysFor all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6461,tyrionWhat of it?
6462,"varysYou don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6463,"tyrionBlood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6464,varysI think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6465,"tyrionMmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6466,"varysAnd yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6467,"tyrionNo, I don't believe you have."
6468,"varysOne day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6469,matthosThey're welcoming the new king.
6470,davosI've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6471,matthosDrums!
6472,"tyrionRemember, wait till the ships-"
6473,bronnThe ships are in the bay.
6474,tyrionThey must be far enough in-
6475,"bronnI know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6476,"tyrionI chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6477,bronnI saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6478,bronnDon't get killed.
6479,"tyrionNor you, my friend."
6480,"bronnOh, are we friends now?"
6481,tyrionOf course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6482,"bronnEnhances it, really."
6483,"tyrionOh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6484,bronnBeen spending time with fancy folks.
6485,tyrionLady Sansa and Sheila.
6486,shaeShae.
6487,"tyrionShae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6488,"sansaShe has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6489,joffreySansa.
6490,"tyrionAlways been a great romantic, my nephew."
6491,"joffreySansa, come here."
6492,"sansaI will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6493,tyrionWill you?
6494,sansaJust as I pray for the king's.
6495,"tyrionStay safe, my lady."
6496,"shaeAnd you, my lion."
6497,joffreyYour king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6498,"joffreyMy new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6499,joffreyYou'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6500,sansaWill you slay him yourself?
6501,joffreyIf Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6502,sansaSo you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6503,joffreyA king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6504,"sansaI'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6505,"joffreyYour brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6506,shaeSome of those boys will never come back.
6507,sansaJoffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6508,"shaeShh. Come, my lady."
6509,lancelWhere's our fleet?
6510,tyrionOn the way.
6511,joffreyWhy isn't it here now? They're coming.
6512,"joffreyHound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6513,sandorThe king has asked you a question.
6514,"tyrionSer Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6515,lancelThe Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6516,"joffreyIf I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6517,"tyrionThat would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6518,davosWhere are their ships?
6519,matthosIt was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6520,davosLord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6521,"matthosIf it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6522,davosMaybe.
6523,sansaI don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6524,shaeMaybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6525,sansaI doubt it.
6526,shaeMaybe she's jealous of you.
6527,sansaWhy would she be jealous?
6528,cerseiSansa.
6529,"cerseiI was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6530,sansaYes.
6531,"cerseiFitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6532,"shaeI'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6533,cerseiSo? I didn't offer you water.
6534,sansaWhat's he doing here?
6535,"cerseiSer llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6536,sansaBut we have guards to defend us.
6537,"cerseiGuards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6538,goldThe lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6539,cerseiThe battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6540,cerseiThe only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6541,sansaYou said he was here to protect us.
6542,cerseiHe is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6543,joffreyThere they are.
6544,tyrionArchers to their marks.
6545,"soldierArchers, to your marks!"
6546,soldierArchers! Nock your arrows!
6547,soldierNock arrows!
6548,tyrionHold fast.
6549,soldierHold fast!
6550,joffreyWhat are you doing? We need to attack them.
6551,soldierBoulders ready!
6552,joffreyThere's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
6553,matthosThere's only one ship.
6554,"davosArchers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
6555,manNock and set!
6556,davosDraw! Hold.
6557,manHold.
6558,davosThere's no one on board.
6559,manMore rocks coming up!
6560,davosWildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
6561,davosMatthos! Get down!
6562,stannisPrepare to land.
6563,soldierYour Grace.
6564,stannisThe dwarf has played his little trick.
6565,soldierThe wildfire.
6566,stannisHe can only play it once.
6567,"soldierWe're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die."
6568,stannisThousands.
6569,stannisCome with me and take this city!
6570,"cerseiSansa, come here, little dove."
6571,sansaMy queen.
6572,cerseiWhat are you doing?
6573,sansaPraying.
6574,"cerseiYou're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
6575,sansaFor the gods to have mercy on us all.
6576,cerseiOh. On all of us?
6577,"sansaYes, Your Grace."
6578,cerseiEven me?
6579,"sansaOf course, Your Grace."
6580,cerseiEven Joffrey?
6581,sansaJoffrey is my-
6582,"cerseiOh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6583,sansaYour father doesn't believe in the gods?
6584,"cerseiHe believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
6585,cerseiOne for her.
6586,cerseiHere. Sit. Drink.
6587,"cerseiNot like that. Drink, girl."
6588,cerseiI should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
6589,sansaThey are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
6590,"cerseiIt was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
6591,sansaAnd if the city should fall?
6592,"cerseiYou'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
6593,"cerseiHave I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
6594,"cerseiDo you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
6595,"manMore pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
6596,"tyrionHe's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
6597,joffreyThey're coming. They're coming ashore.
6598,tyrionRain fire on them.
6599,manArchers!
6600,joffreyThere are too many.
6601,"tyrionHound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
6602,"podrickYes, my lord."
6603,"sandorLet's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
6604,"sandorAny of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
6605,"menPull, pull! Go!"
6606,soldierNock! Draw!
6607,menDraw! Draw!
6608,menKill the Lannisters!
6609,menLoose! Loose!
6610,manForm the line!
6611,menDraw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
6612,"stannisTo the Mud Gate, go now!"
6613,"menFirst and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
6614,"sandorAny man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
6615,"cerseiWhen we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
6616,sansaYou were Robert's queen.
6617,cerseiAnd you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
6618,cerseiPretty.
6619,"cerseiThat's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
6620,cerseiBetter. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
6621,"shaeA few weeks, Your Grace."
6622,cerseiWhen did you leave Lorath?
6623,cerseiI had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
6624,cerseiBut she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
6625,"shaeTen years ago, Your Grace."
6626,"cerseiFrom Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
6627,"shaeShae, Your Grace."
6628,"cerseiTell us a story, Shae."
6629,"shaeWhen I was thireen, I-"
6630,lancelYour Grace!
6631,cerseiWhat news?
6632,"lancelThe Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
6633,cerseiWhere is Joffrey?
6634,lancelOn the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
6635,cerseiBring him back inside at once.
6636,lancelYour Grace-
6637,cerseiWhat?
6638,lancelThe king's presence is good for morale.
6639,cerseiBring him back to his chambers now.
6640,lancelNot here?
6641,cerseiWith the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
6642,"lancelNo, but I-"
6643,cerseiNow!
6644,"cerseiWhen I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
6645,manHelp me!
6646,manFall back! Fall back!
6647,stannisGet the ladders up!
6648,"manFaster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!"
6649,sandorSomeone bring me a drink.
6650,sandorFuck the water. Bring me wine.
6651,"tyrionCan I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
6652,"sandorEat shit, dwarf."
6653,tyrionYou're on the wrong side of the wall.
6654,sandorI lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
6655,"joffreyDog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
6656,"tyrionYou're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
6657,sandorFuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
6658,manLoose!
6659,manPut your backs into it!
6660,"manAll right, get up!"
6661,manClear!
6662,manForward!
6663,manForward ladders!
6664,menHeave! Heave!
6665,"lancelYour Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
6666,"tyrionIf you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
6667,joffreyWhat would you have me do?
6668,tyrionLead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
6669,joffreyWhat did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
6670,"lancelShe did not say, Your Grace."
6671,manAll men to the battlements!
6672,"joffreySer Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle."
6673,"manArchers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself."
6674,manStand fast!
6675,"manNo! Get up, you fool."
6676,manWe need more arrows!
6677,manWhere is the king? Why isn't he with us?
6678,manWho are we fighting for?
6679,manWho leads us?
6680,tyrionI'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
6681,manYes.
6682,manWhat are you talking about?
6683,"tyrionPod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
6684,manThe only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
6685,tyrionThere's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
6686,"tyrionDon't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
6687,menHeave! Heave! Heave!
6688,tyrionThose are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
6689,"lancelThe battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
6690,cerseiWhere is my son?
6691,lancelI want to escort him back to the battle.
6692,cerseiWhy do I care what you want? Bring me-
6693,lancelNow listen to me-
6694,"sansaDon't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
6695,"allSave our sons from war, we pray."
6696,shaeYou must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
6697,sansaCome with me.
6698,shaeI need to say goodbye to someone.
6699,sansaThe queen said they'd rape everyone.
6700,shaeNo one is raping me.
6701,shaeGo. Run.
6702,sandorThe lady is starting to panic.
6703,sansaWhat are you doing here?
6704,sandorNot here for long. I'm going.
6705,sansaWhere?
6706,"sandorSomeplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
6707,sansaWhat about the king?
6708,sandorHe can die just fine on his own.
6709,sandorI can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
6710,sandorI'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
6711,sansaI'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
6712,sandorLook at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
6713,sansaYou won't hurt me.
6714,"sandorNo, little bird, I won't hurt you."
6715,menHeave!
6716,"manCome on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
6717,tyrionAttack!
6718,menRoll it over!
6719,allHalfman! Halfman! Halfman!
6720,"tyrionOh, fuck me."
6721,"cerseiShh! Be calm, my sweet."
6722,tommenThey're still fighting.
6723,cerseiNo one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
6724,tommenThe Kingswood?
6725,"cerseiYes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
6726,tommenLike what?
6727,cerseiLike stags.
6728,tommenStags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
6729,cerseiAnd wolves.
6730,podrickMy lord.
6731,"cerseiHe could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
6732,"cerseiFor one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
6733,"cerseiAnd the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
6734,"cerseiYes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
6735,"cerseiI will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
6736,manBack to the boats!
6737,"stannisStand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
6738,stannisNo!
6739,cerseiFather.
6740,tywinThe battle is over. We have won.
6741,"maleAnd who are you,"" the proud lord said / ""That I must bow so low?"" / ""Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours"" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear"
6742,tyrionPod.
6743,tyrionPod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
6744,"podrickYes, my lord."
6745,pycelleWould you like something for the pain?
6746,tyrionWhat happened?
6747,pycelleThe murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
6748,tyrionWhere am I?
6749,"pycelleThese are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
6750,"pycelleOh, For your trouble."
6751,"joffreyI, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King."
6752,"tywinThank you, Your Grace."
6753,"joffreyLord Petyr Baelish, step forward."
6754,"joffreyFor your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time."
6755,"petyrYou honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
6756,joffreySer Loras Tyrell.
6757,"joffreyYour house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
6758,"lorasYour Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
6759,"joffreyIs this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
6760,"margaeryWith all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
6761,"joffreyI, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
6762,"cerseiYour Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
6763,crowdMargaery! We want Margaery!
6764,"joffreyI would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
6765,"pycelleYour Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
6766,"joffreyThe gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
6767,petyrMy lady. My sincerest condolences.
6768,sansaThey're right. I'm not good enough for him.
6769,"petyrYou shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
6770,"sansaBut, if he's not marrying me-"
6771,"petyrHe'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
6772,sansaKing's Landing is my home now.
6773,petyrLook around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
6774,rosCome in. Make yourself comfortable.
6775,"rosThat doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
6776,"varysNo need for that, my dear."
6777,rosYou sure? Most men like what they see.
6778,varysI'm not like most men.
6779,rosThat's what most men say.
6780,"rosIf you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
6781,varysI would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
6782,rosHave we met?
6783,varysYou wouldn't remember me if we had?
6784,rosI meet a lot of men.
6785,varysAnd I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
6786,"rosYou're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
6787,varysYou're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
6788,rosI know who you are.
6789,"varysAnd, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
6790,rosHow do you know about that?
6791,varysI thought you said you knew who I was.
6792,"rosWhat can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
6793,varysLittlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
6794,rosI'm afraid of him.
6795,"varysOh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
6796,"jaimeYou're a virgin, I take it?"
6797,brienneWalk.
6798,"jaimeChildhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
6799,brienneOne or two tried.
6800,"jaimeAh. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
6801,brienneNot interested.
6802,jaimeOf course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
6803,"jaimeAh. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
6804,brienneI don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
6805,jaimeTell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
6806,jaimeWhat are you doing?
6807,brienneBurying them.
6808,jaimeWe shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
6809,brienneI think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
6810,manI didn't leave it here.
6811,manI had me dagger.
6812,jaimeUntie me. Now!
6813,"manI gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
6814,"manSo unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?"
6815,brienneTraveling a prisoner.
6816,manYou're a woman. A woman!
6817,"manWell, fuck me!"
6818,brienneIf you've quite finished up-
6819,"brienneAll right, we'll be going."
6820,manWhoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
6821,brienneThe Starks.
6822,manWhat did he do?
6823,jaimeApparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
6824,"brienneNo, stealing is a crime."
6825,jaimeBut it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
6826,manWhere are you taking him?
6827,brienneTo Riverrun.
6828,manWhy Riverrun?
6829,"brienneSteal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
6830,manWhy not kill him?
6831,jaimeFor stealing a pig?
6832,brienneI don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
6833,manSending him with you? How important could he be?
6834,"manAll right, have it your way, my lady."
6835,manDo I know you?
6836,jaimeHave you been to Ashemark?
6837,manNo.
6838,jaimeThen you don't know me.
6839,manDo you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
6840,jaimeIs it near Ashemark?
6841,jaimeI've never been there.
6842,manWhat do you think of these beauties?
6843,brienneI hope you gave them quick deaths.
6844,"manTwo of them we did, yeah."
6845,manWait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
6846,jaimeI wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
6847,"brienneIf this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
6848,manHow do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
6849,manI was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
6850,"brienneHe's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
6851,"manI have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three."
6852,brienneTwo quick deaths.
6853,jaimeThose were Stark men.
6854,"brienneI don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
6855,catelynWalder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
6856,robbI know that.
6857,catelynAnd you mean to do it anyway?
6858,robbI love her.
6859,catelynI know that seems important to you.
6860,robbIt is important to me.
6861,"catelynYour father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
6862,"robbAnd that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
6863,catelynWhy not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
6864,robbNow you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
6865,"catelynAnd you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
6866,robbMy father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
6867,stannisYou said you saw my victory in the flames.
6868,melisandrel I did. I still see it.
6869,"stannisThe flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
6870,melisandreThe Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
6871,stannisYou claimed to speak for a god.
6872,melisandreWill you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
6873,stannisYou talk about war as if you understand it.
6874,melisandreI've been fighting far longer than you.
6875,stannisHave you? Show me how you fight.
6876,stannisShow me.
6877,stannisWhere's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
6878,melisandreInside you.
6879,stannisI murdered my brother.
6880,melisandreWe murdered him. Share the weight with me.
6881,stannisHe wasn't your brother.
6882,melisandreThis war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
6883,"stannisYou promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
6884,melisandreLet me show you.
6885,"melisandreLook into the fire, my king. Look."
6886,stannisI see fire.
6887,"melisandreKeep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?"
6888,stannisYes.
6889,"theonI will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
6890,luwinThey want you to know you're surrounded.
6891,theonI know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
6892,luwinThey don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
6893,"theonThank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
6894,theonNo word from my father?
6895,luwinNo.
6896,theonSend more ravens.
6897,luwinYou killed all the ravens.
6898,theonThe first time I saw Winterfell-
6899,"theonFirst time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
6900,luwinLord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
6901,"theonYes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
6902,"theonI will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
6903,"luwinTheon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."
6904,"theonAnd what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
6905,luwinRun. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
6906,"theonThere's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
6907,luwinDon't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
6908,"luwinOnce a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
6909,theonI won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
6910,luwinThere are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
6911,"luwinThe Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
6912,theonThe opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
6913,luwinThe opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
6914,"theonI've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
6915,"luwinI've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
6916,theonYou may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
6917,"theonYou hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
6918,theonThey say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
6919,menAye!
6920,theonYou think they're right?
6921,blackAye.
6922,"theonWe die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
6923,theonMothers will name their sons for us.
6924,theonGirls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
6925,theonAnd whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
6926,theonWhat is dead may never die!
6927,menWhat is dead may never die!
6928,blackThought he'd never shut up.
6929,dagmerIt was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
6930,luwinWhat is this? What are you doing?
6931,dagmerLet's go home.
6932,manCome on.
6933,tyrionWhy should I believe you?
6934,varysWhy would I lie about it?
6935,tyrionTo create strife between my sister and me.
6936,"varysWhere before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
6937,"podrickYes, my lord?"
6938,tyrionWould it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
6939,"podrickNo, my lord."
6940,"tyrionYou're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
6941,varysI'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
6942,tyrionThen my hill tribesmen.
6943,"varysHave gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
6944,tyrionDon't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
6945,"varysWe are. Podrick, would you mind?"
6946,"varysThere are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
6947,"varysCome along now, Podrick."
6948,shaeMy love.
6949,tyrionIt was good of you to come.
6950,shaeGood of me? Of course I come.
6951,shaeI want to see you.
6952,"tyrionBelieve me, you don't."
6953,shaeHave you looked?
6954,shaeI will be the first.
6955,tyrionWell?
6956,shaeYou are a mess.
6957,tyrionI'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
6958,shaeYou think I'm here for money?
6959,tyrionThat was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
6960,"shaeOh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave."
6961,tyrionLeave?
6962,"shaeLeave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here."
6963,tyrionWhat would we do in Pentos?
6964,"shaeEat, drink, fuck, live."
6965,tyrionI want to go with you.
6966,"shaeSo do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me."
6967,"tyrionI can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
6968,shaeYou have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.
6969,"septonIn the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words."
6970,"robbFather, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger."
6971,"talisaFather, smith, warrior, mother,maiden, crone, stranger."
6972,robbI am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
6973,talisaI am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.
6974,"kovarroA house of ghosts, Khaleesi."
6975,kovarroWhere are the guards?
6976,"jorahNo guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel."
6977,daenerysLet them try.
6978,daenerysIs this a riddle?
6979,jorahKhaleesi! Khaleesi!
6980,daenerysAre you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?
6981,hotHow did he find us?
6982,aryaWhat are you doing here?
6983,jaqenWaiting for you.
6984,aryaHow did you know we'd come this way?
6985,"jaqenAfter all the things you have seen, this is your question?"
6986,aryaHow did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
6987,"jaqenNo harder than taking a new name, if you know the way."
6988,"aryaShow me how. I want to be able to do it, too."
6989,"jaqenIf you would learn, you must come with me."
6990,aryaWhere?
6991,jaqenFar and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
6992,aryaMy dancing master was from Braavos.
6993,"jaqenTo be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one."
6994,"aryaI want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too."
6995,jaqenThen we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.
6996,aryaWhat is it?
6997,jaqenA coin of great value.
6998,aryaCould it buy a horse?
6999,jaqenIt is not meant for the buying of horses.
7000,aryaThen what good is it?
7001,"jaqenIf the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, ""Valar Morghulis."""
7002,aryaValar Morghulis.
7003,"aryaPlease don't go, Jaqen."
7004,jaqenJaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis.
7005,jaqenGood.
7006,"jaqenFarewell, Arya Stark."
7007,"branOsha, what are you doing?"
7008,branTell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
7009,rickonWe'll make you better.
7010,luwinI feel just fine.
7011,branThey burned it down. They burned everything.
7012,luwinNot everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
7013,oshaNorth's the wrong way. And mother and brother are south. We don't know where.
7014,"luwinThere are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe."
7015,branI don't want to leave you.
7016,"luwinNo more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here."
7017,luwinOsha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.
7018,oshaI've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it.
7019,luwinI don't want milk of the poppy.
7020,luwinDo it quickly.
7021,drogoMoon of my life.
7022,"daenerysThis is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands."
7023,drogoOr maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
7024,daenerysThat sounds like something you would do.
7025,"drogoOr maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms."
7026,drogoYou are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.
7027,"drogoAnd if this is a dream, I will kill the man who tries to wake me."
7028,"daenerysUntil the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
7029,pyattThey miss their mother.
7030,pyatThey want to be with you.
7031,pyatDo you want to be with them?
7032,pyatYou will be.
7033,"pyatWhen your dragons were born,"
7034,pyatour magic was born again.
7035,pyatIt is strongest in their presence.
7036,pyatAnd they are strongest in yours.
7037,"pyatYou will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again. Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them."
7038,pyatAnd we will be with you until time comes to an end.
7039,"pyatWelcome home, Daenerys Stormborn."
7040,"daenerysThis is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me."
7041,pyatThey will be waiting a long time.
7042,daenerysDracarys.
7043,"ygritteWe should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go."
7044,jonCareful with that. You might cut yourself.
7045,"jonNever swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
7046,rattleshirtEnough of that!
7047,jonStop!
7048,"qhorinWhy, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?"
7049,rattleshirtLet 'em fight.
7050,qhorinThat's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.
7051,qhorinYour traitor father teach you that?
7052,qhorinOr was it your whore mother?
7053,qhorinWe are the watchers on the Wall.
7054,ygritteYou can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
7055,rattleshirtBurn the body.
7056,wildlingAye.
7057,rattleshirtYou don't want this one coming back for you.
7058,"ygritteCome along, Jon Snow."
7059,ygritteTime to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
7060,xaroWhat the-
7061,"doreahKhaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive."
7062,daenerysCome.
7063,daenerysNothing.
7064,"daenerysThank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson."
7065,"xaroI am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. I'll bring you a thousand ships."
7066,"doreahPlease, Khaleesi, I beg you."
7067,xaroAll that you have dreamed is within your reach!
7068,"doreahI beg you, please!"
7069,xaroKhaleesi.
7070,doreahPlease! Please!
7071,xaroKhaleesi!
7072,jorahIt's all a lie.
7073,daenerysLooks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?
7074,"jorahAye, a small ship."
7075,jorahTake all the gold and jewels.
7076,grennI thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.
7077,grennIs this goat?
7078,dolorousIt's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
7079,"grennWell, you see a tree, let me know."
7080,"samIf you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is"
7081,grennJust bloody kill me.
7082,"samNo, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better."
7083,dolorousThe thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
7084,samAnd the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
7085,samIt's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
7086,grennTwo blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.
7087,dolorousCome on.
7088,grennThree blasts?
7089,dolorousRun!
7090,samWait! Wait for me!
7091,samGrenn!
7092,samEdd!
7093,manFall back!
7094,samBrother?
7095,jeorDid you send the ravens?
7096,"jeorTarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
7097,"jeorThat was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."
7098,mainCREDITS
7099,"ygritteFirst time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
7100,"ygritteWell, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
7101,manCrow!
7102,boyCrow!
7103,girlLook over there!
7104,girlCrow! Look over here! Look!
7105,"womanAh, look, crow coming!"
7106,ygritteYou're wearing the wrong color.
7107,jonMance was a ranger.
7108,"ygritteIn your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
7109,"jonWhen I'm free, will I be free to go?"
7110,"ygritteSure, you will."
7111,boyOh!
7112,"ygritteAnd I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
7113,jonWhat happened to their fathers?
7114,"ygritteSome of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
7115,tormundI smell a crow.
7116,rattleshirtWe killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
7117,tormundWhat do we want with a baby crow?
7118,ygritteThis baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
7119,tormundThat half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
7120,jonMy father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
7121,"tormundPlenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
7122,jonJon Snow.
7123,jonYour Grace.
7124,"tormundYour Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart."
7125,"manceStand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
7126,"manceSo, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
7127,"manceThe girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
7128,"tormundDon't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
7129,manceThis chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
7130,tormundCan't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
7131,manceHe was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
7132,manceHe was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
7133,jonThe Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
7134,manceWhy?
7135,jonHe wants me to lead one day.
7136,"manceBut here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
7137,"jonIf I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
7138,"manceWhy do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
7139,jonI want to be free.
7140,"manceNo, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
7141,jonWe stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
7142,manceYou saw what?
7143,jonI saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
7144,manceYou're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
7145,"jonBecause when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
7146,manceWe'll need to find you a new cloak.
7147,bronnWhat if you took off that bit there?
7148,whoreDon't you want to leave something to the imagination?
7149,"bronnTrouble is, I've never had much imagination."
7150,whoreI want you to take it off.
7151,whoreMouth.
7152,podrickSer Bronn. Ser Bronn.
7153,bronnI didn't hear that.
7154,"podrickApologies, ser."
7155,bronnBack away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
7156,podrickLord Tyrion sent me.
7157,"bronnI will murder you, boy."
7158,podrickHe said it was a matter of life and death.
7159,tyrionPod?
7160,cerseiIt's your sister. The queen.
7161,tyrionWhat are they doing here?
7162,"cerseiProtecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
7163,"tyrionNo, I don't think so."
7164,"cerseiIf I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
7165,tyrionThey stay outside.
7166,"cerseiI'm not afraid of you, little brother."
7167,tyrionWhy are you here?
7168,"cerseiI wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7169,tyrionThe man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7170,"cerseiI should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7171,"tyrionThanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7172,cerseiNo? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7173,tyrionGrand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7174,cerseiYou're meeting Father today?
7175,tyrionHow do you know that?
7176,cerseiBecause I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7177,"tyrionWhat do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7178,cerseiYou're going to make me cry.
7179,tyrionWhy do you care what I want from him?
7180,cerseiBecause you've slandered me to Father before.
7181,tyrionSlandered? When?
7182,cerseiYou told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7183,"tyrionYou did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7184,"cerseiI was nine, too."
7185,"tyrionShe lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7186,"cerseiIf I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7187,tyrionIt's not slander if it's true.
7188,cerseiAnd what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7189,tyrionWhy are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7190,"cerseiBecause you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7191,tyrionAny lies in particular?
7192,"cerseiYou're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7193,tyrionStill makes me more clever than you.
7194,"bronnOh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
7195,merynSer Meryn Trant.
7196,bronnSer Bronn of the Blackwater.
7197,merynYou're no knight.
7198,bronnPod.
7199,podrickSer Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
7200,"merynYou're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
7201,"bronnThat's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
7202,"merynYou put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
7203,"bronnAs much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
7204,tyrionA number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
7205,bronnI've been doing that for a while now.
7206,tyrionDo you grow bored protecting me?
7207,bronnI grow poor protecting you.
7208,"tyrionPoor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
7209,bronnBriefly.
7210,tyrionI'm sure you filled your pockets.
7211,"bronnAnd now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
7212,tyrionI thought we were friends.
7213,bronnWe are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
7214,tyrionHow much?
7215,bronnDouble.
7216,tyrionDouble?
7217,bronnI'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
7218,tyrionI don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
7219,bronnWhich means you can afford it.
7220,davosHere. Here! Help me!
7221,manWho are you?
7222,davosI was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
7223,"manAye, ser, and serving which king?"
7224,davosThe one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
7225,salladhorI thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
7226,salladhorHe may have swam ashore as you did.
7227,"davosNo, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7228,"salladhorI'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
7229,"davosIf I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
7230,salladhorHe licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7231,davosWill you take me there?
7232,salladhorThere is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
7233,davosThis war is not over.
7234,"salladhorNot for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
7235,davosWe're both sworn to King Stannis.
7236,salladhorI am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7237,davosStannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7238,"salladhorHe's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7239,davosWhat?
7240,salladhorThey built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7241,salladhorI'm a pirate.
7242,davosYou're a smuggler.
7243,salladhorServants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7244,"davosTake me back there, please."
7245,salladhorYou cannot turn Stannis against her.
7246,"davosMaybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7247,"salladhorYou could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7248,davosYou call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7249,"salladhorAnd you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
7250,"davosI have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
7251,"salladhorWhen you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7252,rooseWe should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7253,robbThere won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7254,rooseI imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7255,robbThe Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7256,rickardTwo hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7257,"rooseThe debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7258,rickardWill it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7259,rooseThe Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7260,robbA Mallister?
7261,catelynSer Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7262,robbFind her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7263,talisaShe's your mother.
7264,robbShe freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
7265,qyburnWater. Water.
7266,talisaThis needs to be cleaned and closed.
7267,"robbWhat's your name, friend?"
7268,qyburnQyburn.
7269,talisaYou're lucky to be alive.
7270,qyburnLucky?
7271,tyrionThe badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7272,tywinAm I enjoying it?
7273,tyrionI was very happy as Hand of the King.
7274,tywinYes. I heard how happy you were.
7275,tywinblows on his paper to dry the ink.
7276,tywinYou brought a whore into my bed.
7277,tyrionIt wasn't your bed at the time.
7278,"tywinI sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7279,tyrionOccasionally I drank with the harlots.
7280,"tywinWhat do you want, Tyrion?"
7281,tyrionWhy does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7282,tywinMaester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7283,"tyrionI organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7284,"tywinJugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7285,"tyrionI want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7286,tywinYou want Casterly Rock?
7287,tyrionIt is mine by right.
7288,"tywinWe'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7289,tyrionWhy?
7290,"tywinWhy? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7291,"tywinOh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7292,sansaDorne. It's going to Dorne.
7293,shaeWhy Dorne?
7294,sansaIt's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7295,shaeI met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7296,sansaDon't ruin the game.
7297,"shaeI told you, I don't want to play."
7298,sansaWhat about that one there?
7299,shaeThat one? It's going to Volantis.
7300,sansaWhy?
7301,"shaeBecause when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7302,sansaThat's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7303,shaeWhy should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7304,sansaBecause the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7305,petyrLovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7306,sansaLord Baelish.
7307,petyrMight I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7308,petyrI saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7309,sansaArya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7310,petyrYou said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7311,sansaI won't tell anyone.
7312,petyrHow do I know?
7313,"sansaBecause I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
7314,"petyrI'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
7315,rosYou're her handmaiden?
7316,shaeYes. And you're his...?
7317,rosI help manage his affairs.
7318,shaeHe's an important person.
7319,"rosSo is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
7320,shaeYes.
7321,rosGiven where we started.
7322,shaeAnd where is that?
7323,rosIt's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
7324,shaeI always do.
7325,rosWatch out for her with him.
7326,jorahThey're growing fast.
7327,daenerysNot fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
7328,jorahWe'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7329,daenerysThe greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7330,jorahDo those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7331,daenerysIt's too beautiful a day to argue.
7332,jorahYou're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
7333,"daenerysDon't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
7334,"jorahThe Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
7335,davosYour Grace.
7336,stannisI heard you were dead.
7337,davosNot yet.
7338,"stannisI had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
7339,stannisWe are alone.
7340,"davosYour Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
7341,stannisI am fighting.
7342,davosBy burning prisoners alive?
7343,"melisandreHow would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
7344,"davosI do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
7345,melisandreI'm not your enemy.
7346,davosYou are my enemy.
7347,"melisandreWas it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
7348,"melisandreDon't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
7349,melisandreDeath by fire is the purest death.
7350,davosThis woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
7351,stannisTake him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
7352,davosYour Grace!
7353,guardCome on.
7354,"melisandreYou've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
7355,davosShe will destroy us all!
7356,melisandreI will pray for you.
7357,guardGuard
7358,guardGuard #2
7359,joffreyWhy have we stopped?
7360,"guardIt's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
7361,joffreyWhat is she doing? Who gave her permission?
7362,"maidMy lady. We should have guards, my lady."
7363,margaeryWhy?
7364,margaeryPardon me.
7365,"maidStop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
7366,margaeryI have others.
7367,"guardWould you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
7368,joffreyNo.
7369,childHe was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
7370,margaeryAnd your mother?
7371,childShe died when she had me.
7372,"margaeryBad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
7373,"margaeryWhenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
7374,childHe wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
7375,margaeryAnd what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
7376,"margaeryWas your father a soldier, too?"
7377,"margaeryYou should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
7378,"margaeryCome to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
7379,margaeryYour Grace.
7380,lorasYour Grace.
7381,"joffreyPlease, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
7382,"joffreyThat's a lovely gown, my lady."
7383,"cerseiYes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
7384,"margaeryThe climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
7385,"joffreyShall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
7386,"margaeryI am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
7387,lorasYes.
7388,"margaeryLoras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7389,cerseiYou might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7390,margaeryYes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
7391,lorasMargaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
7392,margaeryThe lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7393,"cerseiAn open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7394,joffreyMy mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7395,"cerseiYou're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
7396,"margaeryHunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
7397,"joffreyWell, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."
7398,cerseiI'm sure she does.
7399,missandeiThe Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
7400,missandeiThey will stand until they drop.
7401,missandeiSuch is their obedience.
7402,daenerysThey may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
7403,"missandeiThe Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."
7404,kraznysTell her what she would know and be quick about it.
7405,"missandeiThey begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
7406,missandeiTheir discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
7407,jorahEven the bravest men fear death.
7408,missandeiThe knight says even brave men fear death.
7409,kraznysTell the old man he smells of piss.
7410,"missandeiTruly, master?"
7411,"kraznysNo, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
7412,missandeiMy master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
7413,kraznysTell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
7414,"missandeiHe begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
7415,daenerysTell the good master there is no need.
7416,kraznysShe's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
7417,missandeiMy master points out that men don't need nipples.
7418,"kraznysHere, I'm done with you."
7419,unsulliedThis one is pleased to have served you.
7420,"missandeiTo win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
7421,"daenerysYou take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
7422,missandeiShe is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
7423,kraznysWhat a soft mewling fool this one is.
7424,"missandeiMy master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
7425,daenerysHow many do you have to sell?
7426,missandeiEight thousand.
7427,kraznysTell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
7428,missandeiMaster Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
7429,daenerysEight thousand dead babies.
7430,jorahThe Unsullied are a means to an end.
7431,"daenerysOnce I own them, these men..."
7432,jorahThey're not men. Not anymore.
7433,"daenerysOnce I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
7434,jorahDo you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
7435,jorahYou'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7436,jorahYou won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
7437,daenerysThe warlocks.
7438,"daenerysI owe you my life, Ser."
7439,"barristanThe honor is mine, my queen."
7440,daenerysYou know this man?
7441,jorahI know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
7442,"barristanKing Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
7443,"jonDon't think too much, Bran."
7444,jonRelax your bow arm.
7445,eddardAnd which one of you was a marksman at ten?
7446,branFather?
7447,"jojenYou can't kill it, you know."
7448,branWhy not?
7449,jojenBecause the raven is you.
7450,hodorHodor.
7451,"branIt's all right, Hodor."
7452,"oshaWere you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
7453,"branNo, it was the three-eyed raven."
7454,oshaHe's back.
7455,"branI tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
7456,oshaI don't want to hear about it.
7457,branBut you asked.
7458,oshaWe've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
7459,branI didn't ask for black magic dreams.
7460,"oshaI know you didn't, little lord."
7461,oshaWe need to move.
7462,branWe don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
7463,oshaAnd who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
7464,branNo.
7465,"oshaSome good he is, then."
7466,oshaI don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
7467,"talisaMy mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
7468,robbDid you ever think you'd marry one?
7469,talisaI never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
7470,robbNever?
7471,"talisaNot until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
7472,"roosePardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
7473,talisaLord Bolton.
7474,robbLet me guess which one is the good news.
7475,rooseWord from Riverrun and Winterfell.
7476,catelynI hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7477,robbWe'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7478,catelynWill I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7479,catelynSomething else?
7480,"robbBy the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
7481,catelynHave you received any demands?
7482,robbNo.
7483,catelynHave you heard anything from Theon at all?
7484,theonWhere am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7485,torturerI want to do this.
7486,jaimeDo you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7487,brienneYes.
7488,jaimeSo how shall we pass the time?
7489,brienneBy putting one foot in front of the other.
7490,jaimeIt's going to be a very dull walk.
7491,brienneI'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7492,"jaimeYou know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7493,"brienneIf Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7494,jaimeAll the good it's done her.
7495,jaimeHow did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7496,"brienneNot your concern, Kingslayer."
7497,jaimeIt had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7498,brienneHow would you know?
7499,jaimeBecause I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7500,brienneMove.
7501,jaimeWere you pledged to Stannis?
7502,"brienneGods, no."
7503,"jaimeAh, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7504,brienneShut your mouth.
7505,"jaimeWhy? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7506,"brienneI knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7507,jaimeSounds like you quite fancied him.
7508,brienneI did not fancy him.
7509,"jaimeOh, gods, you did."
7510,"jaimeDid you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7511,jaimeHe preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7512,brienneI'm not interested in foul rumors.
7513,jaimeUnless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7514,brienneShut your mouth!
7515,"jaimeI don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7516,"manWhere are you headed, then?"
7517,brienneSouth. You?
7518,"manRiverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
7519,"jaimeNo, you really can't."
7520,"manLooks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
7521,brienneAnd you.
7522,jaimeHe knows who I am.
7523,brienneHe doesn't.
7524,jaimeMaybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7525,brienneWe're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7526,jaimeMore innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7527,joffreyMake it tighter here.
7528,cerseiThat's better. It makes you look very strong.
7529,joffreyNo flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7530,"tailorYes, Your Grace."
7531,joffreyBloody flowers. On the king.
7532,cerseiLooks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7533,cerseiTell me what you think of her.
7534,joffreyWho?
7535,cerseiMargaery.
7536,"joffreyShe's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7537,"cerseiIt is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7538,"joffreyYes, she is."
7539,cerseiHer concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7540,joffreyNot to me.
7541,cerseiI only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7542,joffreyThis is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7543,cerseiMargaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7544,joffreyShe married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7545,cerseiYou need to ask yourself
7546,joffreyI don't need to do anything.
7547,joffreyBetter. Much better.
7548,shaeI still don't believe it.
7549,sansaHe didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7550,shaeMen only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7551,sansaLittlefinger's not in love with me.
7552,shaeLove is not the thing he wants.
7553,sansaHe's too old.
7554,shaeThey never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7555,sansaNo.
7556,"shaeIf he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7557,sansaWhy? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7558,"guardSer Loras Tyrell, my lady."
7559,sansaSend him in.
7560,lorasLady Sansa.
7561,sansaSer Loras.
7562,"lorasMy sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7563,"lorasI believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7564,"sansaYou are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7565,lorasOf course I did.
7566,margaeryIt's more your color. You take it.
7567,maidThank you.
7568,margaeryYou're such a dear.
7569,lorasI'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7570,"sansaThank you, Ser Loras."
7571,"margaeryCome. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7572,"olennaKiss me, child."
7573,olennaIt's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7574,"sansaAnd I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7575,"olennaGallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7576,"margaeryRenly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7577,olennaLoras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7578,margaeryGrandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7579,"olennaShe might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7580,sansaLemon cake's my favorite.
7581,"olennaSo we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7582,olennaDo you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7583,sansaI haven't had the pleasure.
7584,"olennaNo great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7585,"sansaI-, I-"
7586,"olennaYou, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7587,olennaHas he ripped out your tongue?
7588,"sansaJoff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7589,"olennaYes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7590,margaeryI'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7591,olennaBring me some cheese.
7592,"servantThe cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
7593,olennaThe cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7594,"olennaAre you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7595,sansaMy father always told the truth.
7596,"olennaYes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7597,sansaJoffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7598,olennaGo on.
7599,sansaI-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
7600,"margaeryShe's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
7601,"olennaSpeak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
7602,sansaHe's a monster.
7603,olennaAh. That's a pity.
7604,"sansaPlease, don't stop the wedding."
7605,"olennaHave no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
7606,rickardWe're at war. This march is a distraction.
7607,robbMy grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
7608,rickardAre we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7609,rickardThen it's a distraction.
7610,robbMy Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
7611,"rickardUnless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
7612,robbHave you lost faith in our cause?
7613,"rickardIf it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
7614,robbIf you no longer believe-
7615,rickardI can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
7616,robbYou don't think we can win?
7617,"rickardMay I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
7618,"robbHave you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
7619,rickardI think you lost this war the day you married her.
7620,"talisaWhoa, whoa."
7621,manYour Grace.
7622,catelynYou're afraid of her. And she knows it.
7623,"talisaI'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
7624,catelynNo.
7625,"talisaI'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
7626,catelynYou can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
7627,talisaYou've made them before?
7628,catelynTwice.
7629,talisaDid they work?
7630,catelynAfter a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
7631,"catelynMany years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
7632,talisaWhich boy?
7633,"catelynJon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
7634,talisaAnd he lived.
7635,catelynAnd he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
7636,manceWas it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
7637,jonYes.
7638,"manceYou liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."
7639,jonI understand.
7640,"manceWell, how could you understand?"
7641,jonYou want to protect your people.
7642,"manceDo you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
7643,jonNo.
7644,manceI told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
7645,tormundShouldn't be long now.
7646,jonWhat's wrong with him?
7647,"manceHe's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
7648,"ygritteWhat, you've never met a warg?"
7649,manceOrell.
7650,manceWhere were you this time?
7651,orellThe Fist of the First Men.
7652,manceWhat did you see?
7653,orellDead crows.
7654,"rastWhat's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."
7655,"grennHey. Get up, Sam."
7656,samNo.
7657,grennGet up.
7658,samI can't.
7659,"grennIf you stop, you'll die."
7660,"dolorousCourse if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
7661,samYou don't care.
7662,dolorousCourse we care.
7663,"samYou left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
7664,"dolorousAye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die."
7665,grennHelp me get him up.
7666,rastLooks like that piggy is done for.
7667,grennHelp us get him up.
7668,rastHe's slowing us down.
7669,grennJust get him up!
7670,rastWhy? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
7671,"jeorWhat is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
7672,"grennAye, I think so."
7673,"rastIf he can't, we may as well just go without him."
7674,"jeorThat's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?"
7675,rastWhy should the rest of us-
7676,"jeorRast, you're responsible for him."
7677,rastWhat am I supposed to do?
7678,"jeorMake sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
7679,"rastI'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
7680,branWhere's Rickon and Hodor?
7681,oshaLooking for food.
7682,branWhat's out there?
7683,"oshaNot another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
7684,jojenI'm unarmed.
7685,oshaThat was poor planning.
7686,jojenMy sister carries the weapons.
7687,meeraI'm better with them. Drop the spear.
7688,meeraDrop it.
7689,"oshaIf you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
7690,jojenYou must be SUMMER.
7691,"jojenI'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go."
7692,gendryI'm just trying to understand.
7693,aryaWould you please shut up about it?
7694,gendryJaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
7695,aryaI'm not listening.
7696,gendryBut just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
7697,aryaShut up.
7698,gendryYou could have picked Tywin Lannister.
7699,"aryaJaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
7700,gendryBut you could have ended the war.
7701,aryaWhere are we going?
7702,gendryNorth.
7703,"aryaIf we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
7704,gendryMaybe we already passed it.
7705,"aryaIt's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
7706,gendryCould be a minstrel.
7707,thorosA lion still has claws...
7708,"hotA minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
7709,aryaShh.
7710,"thorosAnd so he spoke, and so he spoke"
7711,thorosWhat's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
7712,"anguyJust a dirty little cub, I think."
7713,thorosLoose a few more shafts.
7714,aryaDon't.
7715,"thorosPut the sword down, girl."
7716,aryaYou go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
7717,anguyGenerous.
7718,thorosYou're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
7719,aryaWhat friends?
7720,anguyThe fat to your left and the lad beside him.
7721,thorosThree young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
7722,aryaWho are you?
7723,thorosThoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
7724,"aryaNo, who do you fight for?"
7725,thorosThe Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
7726,hotI'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
7727,"thorosYou've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
7728,"anguyHere's the thing, fat"
7729,"anguyWhen I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
7730,anguyHalf the country's starving and look at this one.
7731,thorosMaybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
7732,shaeMy lion.
7733,tyrionWe've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
7734,shaeBut you said I should come to you with any problems.
7735,tyrionDid anyone see you? No.
7736,shaeNo.
7737,tyrionYou sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
7738,tyrionAll right. What is this problem?
7739,"shaeI'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
7740,tyrionBaelish doesn't have friends.
7741,shaeI don't know her name.
7742,"tyrionOh, Ros? The redhead?"
7743,shaeHow do you know her?
7744,tyrionI try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
7745,shaeShe's a whore.
7746,"tyrionYes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
7747,shaeYou fucked her.
7748,"tyrionOh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
7749,"tyrionBut since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
7750,shaeAnd was she good? Did you like her?
7751,"tyrionNot as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
7752,shaeThat Sansa shouldn't trust him.
7753,tyrionIs there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
7754,shaeWe have to protect her.
7755,"tyrionWe can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
7756,"shaeA great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
7757,"tyrionYes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
7758,shaeYou pervert. You want her? This child?
7759,tyrionI don't even want to talk about her.
7760,shaeBut you are.
7761,tyrionOnly because you're making me.
7762,shaeI didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
7763,tyrionThis is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
7764,"shaeOh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
7765,"tyrionHmm, yes."
7766,shaeNow do you think I'm cruel?
7767,tyrionOnly if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
7768,tyrionDo you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
7769,"guardLady Tyrell, my king."
7770,joffreySend her in.
7771,"margaeryYou wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
7772,joffreyI'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
7773,"margaeryThat's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
7774,joffreyGood. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
7775,margaeryA welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
7776,joffreyAnd the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
7777,"margaeryYour Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
7778,joffreyWhat was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
7779,margaeryThe duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
7780,joffreyYou failed to do this.
7781,"margaeryWhy? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
7782,joffreyYou think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
7783,margaeryNo. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
7784,joffreyWhat makes you say this?
7785,"margaeryWhenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
7786,"joffreyNo, he was a known degenerate."
7787,"margaeryIt's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
7788,joffreyMmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
7789,margaeryAs is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
7790,margaeryYou are the king.
7791,joffreyYes. I am.
7792,joffreyDo you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
7793,margaeryIt's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
7794,joffreyIt's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
7795,joffreyThe bolt goes here.
7796,joffreyAnd then you just aim and-
7797,"margaeryWould you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
7798,joffreyIt's not unheard of.
7799,margaeryMy father would never let me before-
7800,joffreyYou no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
7801,margaeryMay I? Please.
7802,margaeryI imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
7803,joffreyCould you do it? Could you kill something?.
7804,"margaeryI don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
7805,joffreyYes.
7806,margaeryWould you like to watch me?
7807,theonStop! Stop!
7808,torturerTell us the truth.
7809,theonAbout what?
7810,theonI don't know what you want.
7811,torturerI want the truth.
7812,theonWhat truth?
7813,torturerWhy'd you take Winterfell?
7814,theonI took it to-I took it-
7815,torturerWho gave the orders?
7816,theonNo one. I took it on my own.
7817,torturerWhy?
7818,theonTo take the North while it was vulnerable.
7819,torturerWhat were you going to do once you took it?
7820,theonHold it. Rule it.
7821,torturerGood. That's very good.
7822,theonWhy did you do that?
7823,torturerI told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
7824,theonI took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
7825,"theonWait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
7826,theonWhat are you doing?
7827,theonPlease.
7828,"theonI'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
7829,ramsayYour sister sent me.
7830,theonYara?
7831,ramsayI'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
7832,"theonNo, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
7833,"oshaRickon, stay with us."
7834,branIt's all right. The wolves will protect him.
7835,"jojenYou can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
7836,branOnly when I'm asleep.
7837,jojenThat's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
7838,branIt's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
7839,jojenA three-eyed raven?
7840,branYou've seen it?
7841,jojenWe saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
7842,branDoes it have anything to do with warging?
7843,"jojenNo, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
7844,branSeeing things that haven't happened yet?
7845,jojenOr things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
7846,oshaWhat's he telling him?
7847,meeraWhy don't you ask?
7848,"oshaIsn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
7849,meeraWhere's the shame in that?
7850,oshaAny boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
7851,meeraSome people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
7852,"branWhen my father died, I dreamt it."
7853,jojenYou didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
7854,"branYou have the sight, too?"
7855,"jojenWhen I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
7856,branYour father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
7857,jojenYeah.
7858,branHe saved my father's life during the rebellion.
7859,"jojenYour father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
7860,branWhat else have you seen?
7861,jojenOnly one thing that matters-you.
7862,"manI never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
7863,aryaI don't drink ale.
7864,thorosThere's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
7865,manYeah!
7866,"thorosYou see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
7867,aryaWe're not children.
7868,"thorosHow did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
7869,aryaGendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
7870,"thorosA smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
7871,gendryKing's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
7872,thorosThat criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
7873,gendryThat's because he's twice as good.
7874,thorosAha! A smith and a salesman.
7875,aryaGendry stole us weapons.
7876,"thorosAh, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
7877,aryaHe knows how to use a sword and so do I.
7878,aryaMy brothers taught me.
7879,menOoh!
7880,thorosTo your brothers!
7881,thorosYou can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
7882,aryaYou'll free us?
7883,thorosI gave you my word.
7884,"thorosBut before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
7885,"anguyHey, hey."
7886,thorosNow that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
7887,anguyOne waits for him to drink until he passes out.
7888,thorosPoor man. You have my sympathy.
7889,"thorosAha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
7890,"thorosSo good to see you again, Clegane."
7891,sandorThoros? The fuck you doing here?
7892,thorosDrinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
7893,"thorosA pretty prize, lads."
7894,menYeah!
7895,sandorGirl.
7896,sandorWhat in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
7897,jaimeIt's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
7898,"brienneSilence, Kingslayer."
7899,"jaimeAnyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
7900,brienneGood luck.
7901,jaimeIt's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
7902,jaimeGambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
7903,brienneBe quick about it.
7904,jaimeI need to rest.
7905,brienneGet up.
7906,"jaimeI have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
7907,brienneGet up now.
7908,"jaimeCorns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
7909,jaimeThis heel is ruined. There's no way-
7910,jaimeI never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
7911,jaimeOoh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
7912,jaimeYou shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
7913,"jaimeBit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
7914,"jaimeYou're good. Graceless, but good."
7915,"jaimeSee? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
7916,"lockeLooks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
7917,jaimeWe enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
7918,lockeYou sure he's the one?
7919,"manThat's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
7920,lockeGive the man his silver.
7921,jaimeLet us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
7922,"lockeEnough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
7923,"edmureIf I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
7924,"bryndenWhy don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
7925,edmureRobb knows I meant him no disr-
7926,bryndenYou're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
7927,"edmureMy blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
7928,robbIt's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
7929,edmureI seized an opportunity.
7930,robbWhat value was the mill?
7931,edmureThe Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
7932,robbIs he there now? Of course not.
7933,edmureWe took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
7934,"robbI wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
7935,edmureWe took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
7936,robbWillem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
7937,"bryndenMartyn is fifteen, I believe."
7938,robbTywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
7939,edmureNo.
7940,robbDo you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
7941,robbHow many men did you lose?
7942,"edmureBut for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
7943,robbWe need our men more than Tywin needs his!
7944,edmureI'm sorry. I didn't know.
7945,robbYou would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
7946,bryndenWe seem to be running short of patience here.
7947,robbYou know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
7948,tyrionIntimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
7949,tywinWhat news of Jaime?
7950,"tywinTwenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
7951,"varysWe are trying, my lord."
7952,"tywinTry harder. What do we have, then?"
7953,"varysRobb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
7954,"tywinWell, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
7955,"petyrFor which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
7956,pycelleA successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
7957,petyrTitles do seem to breed titles.
7958,tywinYou'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
7959,"tyrionFar be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
7960,tywinFully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
7961,tyrionMaster of Coin?
7962,tywinIt would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
7963,"tyrionI'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
7964,cerseiI have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
7965,"pycelleHear, hear."
7966,"menHe lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
7967,"jaimeI hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
7968,brienneYou were armed when we were taken.
7969,jaimeI was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
7970,"brienneAll my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
7971,jaimeI've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
7972,brienneAnd I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
7973,jaimeYou were not beating me.
7974,brienneMaybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
7975,"jaimeWhen we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
7976,brienneWould I?
7977,jaimeThey'll knock your teeth out.
7978,brienneYou think I care about my teeth?
7979,"jaimeNo, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
7980,brienneWhat does it matter?
7981,jaimeClose your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
7982,"brienneIf you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
7983,"jaimeIf I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
7984,"gendryIf I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
7985,thorosDoesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
7986,aryaWhy are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
7987,"thorosYou're not our prisoner, little lady."
7988,aryaWhat am I?
7989,thorosOur guest. No one's put any chains on you.
7990,"aryaSo I can walk away, then?"
7991,thorosThese woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
7992,"sandorYou think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
7993,anguyBetter than anyone you've ever met.
7994,sandorA cowardo s weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
7995,anguyWhy? So you can kiss him?
7996,aryaYou remember the last time you were here?
7997,sandorLooks like every other shit inn on the road.
7998,"anguyNow, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
7999,anguyWatch your head. Off we go.
8000,driverWalk up!
8001,aryaWhat are you doing? We're about to leave.
8002,hotI'm staying.
8003,gendryYou're what?
8004,"hotI baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
8005,aryaWinterfell.
8006,hotYou sure?
8007,aryaI'm sure.
8008,"hotWell, I made you something."
8009,aryaWhat is it?
8010,hotIt's a wolf.
8011,"gendryYes, it is."
8012,aryaThat's the tail?
8013,hotYeah.
8014,"gendryWell, be safe."
8015,"hotYeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
8016,gendryYou don't burn your fingers.
8017,"aryaGood-bye, Hot Pie."
8018,"hotGood-bye, Arry."
8019,"manUp you go, little lady."
8020,"aryaHey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
8021,catelynA person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
8022,"bryndenIt often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
8023,"catelynI've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
8024,bryndenMaybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
8025,catelynI'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
8026,"bryndenAfter thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
8027,"catelynEvery time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
8028,bryndenYou mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
8029,martynYou're Robb Stark's wife.
8030,talisaHold still.
8031,martynIs it true what they say about him?
8032,talisaI don't know. What do they say about him?
8033,martynThat he can turn into a wolf at night.
8034,talisaTrue.
8035,martynAnd he eats the flesh of his enemies.
8036,"talisaTrue. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
8037,martynMartyn Lannister.
8038,"talisaMartyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
8039,manceAlways the artists.
8040,jonIt's only horses. No men.
8041,ygritteYou said there was dead crows.
8042,orellThere was.
8043,manceHow many men were here?
8044,jonAbout three hundred.
8045,manceAnd you know what those men are now?
8046,manceWe're all the same to them - meat for their army.
8047,jonDo you think anyone got away?
8048,"manceIt's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
8049,"tormundWe're finally going to war, old friend?"
8050,"manceHide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
8051,tormundWe'll meet again.
8052,manceAye. If you do your job. Ah.
8053,orellHow will we see your signal?
8054,"manceSend your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
8055,samGhost?
8056,crasterWhat have we here? Frozen crows?
8057,jeorWe've come a long way.
8058,crasterSmaller flock than you went north with.
8059,jeorWe can talk inside.
8060,"crasterOh, can we?"
8061,womanThey need some water.
8062,womanTether it and I'll be inside.
8063,crasterKeep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
8064,karlBet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
8065,"crasterAye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
8066,jeorYou are a godly man?
8067,"crasterI am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
8068,"crasterGo tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
8069,womanHere we are.
8070,"womanSharpen these for me, would ya?"
8071,womanI see the head. Push.
8072,womanThat's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
8073,gillyWhat is it? What is it?
8074,ramsayKeep quiet.
8075,"ramsayIf you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
8076,theonI can ride.
8077,ramsayYou're sure?
8078,ramsayRide east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
8079,theonI'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
8080,ramsayWe're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
8081,theonCome on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
8082,manCome on back.
8083,stannisYou refuse to tell me where you're going?
8084,melisandreI don't know yet. The fires will show me.
8085,stannisHow long will you be gone?
8086,melisandreI don't know.
8087,stannisYou're abandoning me.
8088,melisandreI will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.
8089,stannisThen serve me.
8090,"melisandreWhen I return, you will understand."
8091,stannisMy enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
8092,melisandreI cannot.
8093,stannisWhy?
8094,melisandreYou don't have the strength. It would kill you.
8095,stannisI'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
8096,stannisI want you.
8097,"melisandreYour fires burn low, my king."
8098,melisandreThere is another way. A better way.
8099,stannisYou told me your magic requires a king's blood.
8100,melisandreYes.
8101,stannisI'm the one true king.
8102,"melisandreYou are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
8103,"barristanThe Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
8104,daenerysTo whom?
8105,barristanTo any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
8106,daenerysGive me your water.
8107,"jorahKhaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
8108,"daenerysHere, drink."
8109,"barristanLeave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."
8110,jorahAnd what is she to do for soldiers?
8111,barristanWe can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
8112,"jorahIs it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
8113,"daenerysThe blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
8114,"jorahHow many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
8115,barristanThree.
8116,jorahHave you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
8117,"jorahI was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
8118,"daenerysDo you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
8119,"barristanWhen your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
8120,"jorahRhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
8121,"daenerysDid you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
8122,"barristanI did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
8123,daenerysI wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
8124,"missandeiAll? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
8125,daenerysThey did not. I want to buy them all.
8126,missandeiShe wants to buy them all.
8127,"kraznysShe can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
8128,missandeiThere are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
8129,daenerysYes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
8130,"greizhenIf they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor."
8131,"missandeiMaster Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
8132,daenerysI will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
8133,kraznysThe slut cannot pay for all of this.
8134,missandeiMaster Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
8135,"kraznysHer ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
8136,missandeiYour ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
8137,kraznysAnd this is because I like the curve of her ass.
8138,missandeiThe gold you have left is worth ten.
8139,kraznysWhat is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
8140,missandeiBut good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
8141,kraznysHer Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
8142,missandeiThe Dothraki you have with you-
8143,kraznysI will give her three for those.
8144,"missandeiThe Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
8145,"kraznysSo, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
8146,"missandeiMaster Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
8147,daenerysI have dragons. I'll give you one.
8148,"barristanYou will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
8149,"jorahKhaleesi, please."
8150,kraznysThree dragons.
8151,daenerysOne.
8152,kraznysTwo.
8153,missandeiThey want the biggest one.
8154,daenerysDone.
8155,kraznysDone.
8156,"daenerysI'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
8157,"missandeiShe asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
8158,"jorahKhaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
8159,barristanAegon Targaryen proved that.
8160,"daenerysYou're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
8161,daenerysDo you have a name?
8162,"missandeiThis one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
8163,daenerysDo you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
8164,"missandeiNo, Your Grace. No family living."
8165,daenerysYou belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
8166,"missandeiYes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
8167,daenerysI offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
8168,"missandeiThere are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
8169,daenerysIs it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
8170,"missandeiAll questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
8171,daenerysAnd what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
8172,missandeiValar morghulis.
8173,"daenerysYes, all men must die. But we are not men."
8174,tyrionA surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
8175,petyrI'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
8176,tyrionNot for bastards.
8177,"rosThat's all of them, my lord."
8178,"petyrThank you, my dear."
8179,tyrionPod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
8180,"podrickYes, my lord."
8181,petyrI hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
8182,"tyrionOnly my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
8183,petyrYou should have him knighted.
8184,tyrionIf only the Master of Coin had such power.
8185,petyrIf only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
8186,"tyrionOh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
8187,"petyrApparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
8188,tyrionWe don't. I did fuck her once.
8189,petyrI know.
8190,tyrionBut we don't.
8191,petyrI know. But how would the queen get that idea?
8192,tyrionWhy don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
8193,petyrKeep a low profile.
8194,"tyrionIf I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
8195,"petyrWell, you are richer than I am."
8196,tyrionGood point.
8197,"petyrThey're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
8198,"tyrionI've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
8199,"bronnCome on, I'm here later. Come on."
8200,"bronnTonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
8201,tyrionYou think all reading is dull reading.
8202,bronnIt's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
8203,tyrionThe secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
8204,bronnUnless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
8205,"tyrionUnless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
8206,tyrionPodrick.
8207,"podrickYes, my lord?"
8208,"tyrionAfter a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
8209,"podrickNo, my lord."
8210,tyrionWonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
8211,"bronnShe's not bad with second-timers, either."
8212,"podrickUh, my lord"
8213,"tyrionA fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
8214,"tyrionNow, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
8215,mareiHe's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
8216,tyrionKayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
8217,"podrickMy lord, I don't even"
8218,tyrionShe's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
8219,tyrionBe back in time for my supper.
8220,"bronnPace yourself, lad."
8221,"tyrionFor years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
8222,bronnLet me guess. He's not a magician.
8223,tyrionNo.
8224,bronnHe's stealing it?
8225,"tyrionWorse, he's borrowing it."
8226,bronnWhat's wrong with that?
8227,"tyrionWe can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
8228,"bronnSeeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
8229,"tyrionForgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
8230,bronnI've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
8231,"tyrionWell, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
8232,bronnAnd what if I don't?
8233,"tyrionWell, you have to."
8234,bronnBut what if I don't?
8235,"tyrionThis is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
8236,"tyrionAh, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
8237,bronnThe lado s practically skipping.
8238,tyrionYou were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
8239,"tyrionOh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
8240,bronnHe's a squire. You don't pay him.
8241,"tyrionOh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
8242,"podrickThey wouldn't take it, my lord."
8243,bronnMaybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
8244,tyrionHave you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
8245,bronnWhat did you tell them?
8246,podrickI didn't tell them anything.
8247,tyrionWhat did you do to them?
8248,podrickLots of things.
8249,tyrionAnd they seemed to like these things?
8250,bronnOf course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
8251,tyrionOnly they weren't paid.
8252,"bronnWhat are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
8253,tyrionIs that what you're telling us?
8254,podrickdoesn't deny it.>/i>
8255,"tyrionSit down, Podrick."
8256,tyrionWe're going to need details. Copious details.
8257,theonCome on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
8258,soldierHa! Ha!
8259,"soldierYou know how we deal with runaways here, do you?"
8260,soldierTake off his pants.
8261,"theonNo! No! No, no, no!"
8262,soldierI'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
8263,"theonNo, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"
8264,"theonNo, please! No! No!"
8265,soldierYou little bastard.
8266,"ramsayCome, my lord."
8267,ramsayYou're a long way from home and winter is coming.
8268,"lockeI'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
8269,"brienneMy lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
8270,lockeCatelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
8271,manYou're only making it worse.
8272,lockeTake her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
8273,manCome on!
8274,"jaimeYou know who she is, don't you?"
8275,lockeA big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
8276,jaimeShe's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
8277,manI'm gonna cut your throat!
8278,jaimeThey call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
8279,lockeI know what they are.
8280,"jaimeLord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
8281,lockeBring her back here.
8282,"manYes, my lord. Get up."
8283,manCome on.
8284,"manCome on, on your feet."
8285,lockeUnbesmirched.
8286,jaimeNot defiled.
8287,lockeFancy word for a fancy man.
8288,"jaimeI hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
8289,lockeI bet you did.
8290,"lockeYour father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
8291,"jaimeYou'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
8292,"lockeAye, you have both."
8293,jaimeFighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
8294,lockeHard to argue with that.
8295,"jaimeNow that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
8296,lockeNone of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
8297,"manCome on, men."
8298,lockeSuppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
8299,"jaimeI'm famished, actually."
8300,lockeI think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
8301,"jaimeWell, I do like partridge."
8302,"lockeBring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?"
8303,"jaimeOh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
8304,lockeOn the stump.
8305,lockeYou think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
8306,jaimeMy father-
8307,"lockeAnd if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
8308,jaimeDon't.
8309,lockeHave you got something to say?
8310,"lockeCareful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."
8311,"lockeHere, this should help you remember."
8312,endCREDITS
8313,manHow many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
8314,"lockeDepends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
8315,brienneHe's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
8316,"jaimeWater. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
8317,"jaimeIf I die, you won't be getting-"
8318,"lockeOh, enough. Here."
8319,lockeCan't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
8320,brienneStop!
8321,manFar enough.
8322,lockeDo that again and I'll take your other hand.
8323,"manCome on, you."
8324,"varysOh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
8325,tyrionI hope we might speak. In confidence.
8326,"varysOh, always in confidence."
8327,tyrionAbout the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
8328,"varysOh, no. It's a wonderful time."
8329,tyrionI thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8330,varysEnd your life?
8331,"tyrionI didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8332,varysProof? Will there be a trial?
8333,tyrionI need to know.
8334,"varysI have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8335,tyrionI don't know. Do I?
8336,"varysAs a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8337,"tyrionYes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8338,varysYou do not possess at the moment.
8339,"varysBut influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8340,tyrionThe sorcerer.
8341,"varysHello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8342,"grennWhen people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8343,dolorousOr the shit.
8344,"grennThey tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8345,dolorousAnd getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8346,"grennBut when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8347,"dolorousOh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8348,rastWe need to get out of here.
8349,"grennWhen the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8350,rastThe Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8351,dolorousHe had no way of knowing.
8352,rastWe do now. We know what's out there.
8353,grennCraster's been out here surviving.
8354,rastSo he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
8355,dolorousWe're like the sons he never had.
8356,"rastMormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."
8357,"gillyShh, shh, shh."
8358,gillyYou woke him.
8359,samI'm sorry. He's beautiful.
8360,gillyShh!
8361,samHe's beautiful. Does he have a name?
8362,gillyNo.
8363,samAre you going to give him one?
8364,gillyWhy?
8365,gillyHere.
8366,samGilly.
8367,gillyYou said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
8368,samI wanted you to have it.
8369,gillyI don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
8370,gillyI don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
8371,jojenYou have to go after him.
8372,branHow?
8373,jojenYou know how.
8374,catelynBrandon.
8375,branMother.
8376,catelynHow many times have I told you? No climbing.
8377,"branMother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
8378,catelynI want you to promise me. No more climbing.
8379,catelynPromise me. Promise me! Promise me!
8380,branMother! Mother!
8381,"catelynPromise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
8382,varysIs he very large?
8383,"rosNo larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
8384,varysExtraordinary.
8385,rosThe most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
8386,varysWe're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
8387,varysWhat did he do to them?
8388,"rosI don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
8389,varysSo what did they say?
8390,rosThey said it was hard to describe.
8391,varysHuh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8392,rosHe was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8393,"varysAh, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8394,"rosHe hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8395,varysWhat makes you say so?
8396,rosHis shipboard inventory.
8397,varysAh. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8398,rosFormer profession.
8399,varysOf course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8400,rosTwo featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8401,varysWho is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8402,"rosHe's not interested in them, my lord."
8403,varysHow do you know?
8404,rosBecause I'm one of his girls.
8405,varysProdigies in odd places indeed.
8406,gendryWhat is this place?
8407,thorosSomewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
8408,sandorYou look like a bunch of swineherds.
8409,anguySome of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
8410,sandorYou're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
8411,bericNo. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
8412,sandorBeric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
8413,bericAnd I won't see them again.
8414,sandorStark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
8415,"bericLast I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
8416,sandorUntie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
8417,bericNed Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
8418,sandorNed Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
8419,sandorYou're fighting for ghosts.
8420,"bericThat's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
8421,sandorYou found god? Is that it?
8422,bericAye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
8423,"sandorIf you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
8424,"thorosYou'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
8425,"anguyAnd a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
8426,sandorI wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
8427,thorosHouse Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
8428,sandorDo you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
8429,anguyMurder is a crime.
8430,"sandorI never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
8431,aryaYou murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
8432,"sandorAye, he was a bleeder."
8433,bericYou don't deny killing this boy?
8434,sandorI was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
8435,aryaThat's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
8436,sandorThen I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
8437,"bericYou stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
8438,"sandorSo, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
8439,bericAye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
8440,"missandeiThe master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."
8441,"missandeiAnd who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."
8442,"daenerysIs it done, then? They belong to me?"
8443,kraznysIt is done.
8444,missandeiIt is done.
8445,kraznysShe holds the whip.
8446,missandeiYou hold the whip.
8447,kraznysThe bitch has her army.
8448,daenerysUnsullied!
8449,daenerysForward march!
8450,daenerysHalt!
8451,kraznysTell the bitch her beast won't come.
8452,daenerysA dragon is not a slave.
8453,kraznysYou speak Valyrian?
8454,"daenerysI am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
8455,"daenerysUnsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!"
8456,kraznysI am your master.
8457,kraznysKill her! Kill her! Kill her!
8458,daenerysDracarys.
8459,"daenerysUnsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?"
8460,"thorosLord, cast your light upon us."
8461,"menLord of Light, defend us."
8462,"thorosShow us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
8463,menFor the night is dark and full of terrors.
8464,thorosGet back.
8465,menGuilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
8466,aryaKill him!
8467,"thorosLord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it."
8468,"thorosFor the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-"
8469,"gendryArya, don't!"
8470,thorosBring him back from death and darkness
8471,aryaNo! Let go of me! Let me go!
8472,sandorLooks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
8473,aryaBurn in hell!
8474,bericHe will. But not today.
8475,tormundOrell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
8476,"jonThere are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
8477,orellHow often do these patrols go out?
8478,"jonIt varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
8479,orellYou'd like to know that.
8480,tormundThere are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
8481,jonThree.
8482,orellYou sure of that?
8483,orellWhich three?
8484,jonCastle Black.
8485,"orellAye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?"
8486,jonEastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
8487,tormundHow many men remain in Castle Black?
8488,jonA thousand.
8489,orellLiar.
8490,jonWhat happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
8491,ygritteHe's no crow.
8492,orellJust 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
8493,ygritteI'm not afraid of you.
8494,"tormundI like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."
8495,jonA thousand men.
8496,tormundWe'll find out soon enough.
8497,jonI don't need you to protect me.
8498,ygritteOf course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
8499,jonGive it back.
8500,"ygritteWell, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
8501,jonYgritte! Ygritte!
8502,jonYgritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
8503,ygritteIs Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
8504,jonYgritte.
8505,ygritteYou swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
8506,ygritteAll of me.
8507,jonWe shouldn't.
8508,ygritteWe should.
8509,"ygritteWhy are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-"
8510,ygritteThat thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
8511,jonI don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
8512,ygritteHmm.
8513,jonYou seemed to like it.
8514,"ygritteAye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
8515,jonThere's been no one else. Only you.
8516,ygritteA maid. You were a maid.
8517,jonI was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
8518,ygritteWhat do you think?
8519,jonWho was he?
8520,"ygritteJust a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
8521,"jonYeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
8522,ygritteI'm not done with you yet.
8523,ygritteHow long's it been since you had a bath?
8524,"ygritteLet's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
8525,sandorI want my gold.
8526,thorosIt says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
8527,sandorPiss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
8528,anguyWe're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
8529,"sandorCome try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
8530,aryaYou can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
8531,bericNot in the eyes of god.
8532,aryaYou can't!
8533,bericEnough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
8534,"bericGo in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."
8535,manRiders coming through!
8536,manThe Kingslayer.
8537,manDown!
8538,"lockeOn your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
8539,"roosePick him up, Locke."
8540,rooseYou've lost a hand.
8541,"lockeNo, my lord, he has it here."
8542,rooseTake this away.
8543,lockeSend it to his father?
8544,rooseYou'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
8545,"rooseCut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
8546,"brienneThank you, my lord."
8547,rooseFind suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
8548,jaimeLord Bolton.
8549,jaimeIs there word from the capital?
8550,rooseYou haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
8551,rooseSer Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
8552,jaimeWill I die?
8553,qyburnNo. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
8554,jaimeThen you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
8555,"qyburnThe Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
8556,jaimeI don't need my right hand to kill you.
8557,qyburnI can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
8558,jaimeMmm.
8559,"qyburnWith any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
8560,jaimeNo milk of the poppy.
8561,qyburnThere will be pain.
8562,jaimeI'll scream.
8563,qyburnQuite a bit of pain.
8564,jaimeI'll scream loudly.
8565,cerseiLord Baelish.
8566,petyrYour Grace.
8567,cerseiI wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
8568,"petyrOf course, Your Grace."
8569,cerseiI have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
8570,petyrI see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
8571,cerseiMy father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
8572,"petyrMyself, I often find them a hindrance."
8573,"cerseiAnd he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
8574,petyrI shall do my best.
8575,cerseiThank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
8576,petyrI assure you that it will.
8577,"olennaGods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
8578,"podrickPardon, my lady."
8579,olennaNo need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
8580,"tyrionThank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
8581,olennaI climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
8582,tyrionIt's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
8583,olennaNaturally.
8584,tyrionIt's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
8585,olennaWhat good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
8586,tyrionI understand that.
8587,olennaGood.
8588,"tyrionBut, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
8589,olennaAnd?
8590,"tyrionAnd we're at war, Lady Olenna."
8591,"olennaOh, I'd nearly forgotten."
8592,"tyrionYes, and maintaining supply lines-"
8593,"olennaI can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
8594,tyrionAnd we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
8595,"olennaAs is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
8596,tyrionI would.
8597,olennaAnd traditionally paid for by the royal family.
8598,"olennaI was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
8599,tyrionMy lady-
8600,"olennaOh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
8601,tyrionQuite sufficient. Thank you.
8602,"olennaVery good, then. That's settled. Good day."
8603,tyrionGive me that.
8604,aryaWhat are you doing?
8605,gendryJust mending Lord Beric's armor.
8606,aryaWhy?
8607,gendryI'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
8608,"aryaHave you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
8609,gendryThe Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
8610,aryaYou don't have to do this.
8611,gendryI want to. They need good men.
8612,"aryaRobb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
8613,"gendryWhat? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
8614,aryaYou just said you were serving Lord Beric.
8615,"gendryHe may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
8616,aryaI can be your family.
8617,gendryYou wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
8618,martynWillem. Willem!
8619,willemIs this a rescue?
8620,rickardLannister filth! Take him!
8621,"martynPlease, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
8622,robbBring them in.
8623,robbIs that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
8624,"rickardNot murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
8625,robbVengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
8626,rickardWas strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
8627,robbThey were boys! Look at them.
8628,rickardTell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
8629,robbMy mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
8630,"rickardIt's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
8631,robbLeave him.
8632,rickardAye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
8633,robbEscort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
8634,"manMercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
8635,robbThis one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
8636,"manPlease! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
8637,edmureWord of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
8638,robbWould you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
8639,edmureIt wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
8640,"robbI'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
8641,catelynThe Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
8642,"talisaYour mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
8643,robbYou tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
8644,talisaAnd more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
8645,catelynSpare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
8646,"edmureA hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
8647,"rickardThe blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
8648,robbThat didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
8649,rickardI don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
8650,"robbKneel, my lord."
8651,"robbRickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
8652,rickardKill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
8653,aryaJoffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
8654,thorosAt first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
8655,aryaI'm a hostage and you're selling me.
8656,thorosDon't think of it that way.
8657,aryaBut it is that way.
8658,thorosIt is. And it isn't.
8659,aryaMore is than isn't.
8660,"thorosBeric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
8661,aryaSo why don't you?
8662,thorosWe need the gold.
8663,"bericDo I frighten you, child?"
8664,aryaNo.
8665,bericYou're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
8666,aryaI thought he killed you.
8667,bericHe did.
8668,aryaBut how?
8669,bericThoros how many times have you brought me back?
8670,thorosIt's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
8671,bericHow many times?
8672,"thorosFive, I think. No, this makes six."
8673,bericSix.
8674,thorosThere was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
8675,bericThen I was stabbed in the belly.
8676,thorosThen it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
8677,bericThen the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
8678,thorosBoth. Fuckers couldn't decide.
8679,thorosAnd the Hound makes six.
8680,bericSecond time I've been killed by a Clegane.
8681,"thorosYou'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
8682,"bericI know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
8683,aryaCould you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
8684,"thorosI don't think it works that way, child."
8685,"bericHe was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
8686,aryaI would. You're alive.
8687,"selyseLord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
8688,selyseI have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
8689,stannisMy lady.
8690,stannisI meant to come sooner. The battle-
8691,"selyseI know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
8692,"stannisYes, of course."
8693,selyseYou mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
8694,stannisI believed that once.
8695,selyseYou are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
8696,stannisSelyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
8697,selyseNo.
8698,stannisI've wronged you. I have shamed you.
8699,selyseYou're doing godo s work.
8700,stannisYou don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
8701,"selyseI know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
8702,"selyseOh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."
8703,stannisThat's not true.
8704,selyseSo you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
8705,stannisShe's my daughter. I want to see her.
8706,selyseYou are a king. You don't need my permission.
8707,"shireenUnder the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh"
8708,"shireenThe birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh"
8709,stannisShireen.
8710,shireenFather!
8711,stannisYou've grown since I last saw you.
8712,shireenMother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
8713,stannisNo.
8714,shireenDid the Onion Knight come back with you?
8715,stannisHe did. He fought bravely.
8716,shireenHe hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
8717,"stannisHe won't be visiting, child."
8718,shireenWhy not? He's my friend. Look.
8719,shireenHe made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
8720,stannisSer Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
8721,jaimeNot so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
8722,brienneWhat are you doing here?
8723,jaimeI need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
8724,jaimeNow get out.
8725,brienneThere's another tub.
8726,"jaimeThis one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
8727,brienneWhy should I care how you die?
8728,"jaimeYou swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
8729,jaimeThat was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
8730,brienneDon't you mock me.
8731,jaimeI'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
8732,brienneYou need trust to have a truce.
8733,jaimeI trust you.
8734,jaimeThere it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
8735,brienneOf course.
8736,"jaimeThe Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
8737,"jaimeFirst, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
8738,brienneIf this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
8739,jaimeStark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
8740,brienneHelp! Help! The Kingslayer!
8741,jaimeJaime. My name is Jaime.
8742,shireenOnion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
8743,"davosPrincess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
8744,"shireenShh, you'll wake Bert."
8745,davosBert?
8746,shireenHe's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
8747,davosGo back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
8748,shireenhe said you Were a traitor. Are you?
8749,"davosI am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
8750,shireenI don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
8751,davosAye. So they did.
8752,shireenYou can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
8753,"davosThank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
8754,shireenTake it. I have more.
8755,"davosMy lady, I can't read the words."
8756,shireenYou can't?
8757,shireenI'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
8758,davosNo. No. No.
8759,shireenIt's easy. It'll be fun.
8760,davosGo. We can't.
8761,"shireenWhy not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
8762,davosI wouldn't know where to start.
8763,"shireenAt the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
8764,jorahIt was a bitch of a siege.
8765,"barristanMm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
8766,"jorahThe second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
8767,barristanThoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
8768,"jorahProudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
8769,jorahIn full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
8770,"barristanRobert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
8771,jorahYou swore an oath.
8772,"barristanYes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
8773,jorahWith all my heart.
8774,daenerysThese are the ones?
8775,"missandeiYes, khaleesi. The officers."
8776,daenerysYou did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
8777,daenerysRemove your helmet
8778,greyThis one has the honor.
8779,daenerysWhat is your name?
8780,greyGrey Worm.
8781,daenerysGrey Worm.
8782,"missandeiAll Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
8783,"daenerysFrom this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
8784,"greyGrey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
8785,jorahKing Robert wanted her dead.
8786,barristanOf course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
8787,jorahI suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
8788,barristanI didn't sit on the small council.
8789,jorahNo? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
8790,"barristanTraditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
8791,barristanHe didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
8792,"jorahYeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
8793,barristanMm-hmm.
8794,"jorahStill, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
8795,"barristanShe'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
8796,jorahWhich men do you have in mind?
8797,"barristanForgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
8798,jorahIt suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
8799,barristanI don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
8800,"jorahOur cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
8801,barristanWe both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
8802,jorahYou only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
8803,"barristanIf we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
8804,jorahYou're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
8805,talisaCome to bed.
8806,robbYou were right.
8807,robbThe Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
8808,talisaDon't let him.
8809,robbWhat can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
8810,talisaWe could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
8811,"robbWinter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
8812,talisaGive them a new purpose.
8813,robbWhat?
8814,"talisaOh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
8815,robbHere. And we're here. King's Landing-
8816,talisaWhat is it?
8817,"robbI can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
8818,robbAnd Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
8819,talisaCan you do it?
8820,robbI need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
8821,sansaHe's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
8822,margaeryI'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
8823,sansaJoffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
8824,margaeryAnd only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
8825,lorasSquire!
8826,"olyvarWell fought, ser."
8827,lorasThat was no fight. I don't know you.
8828,"olyvarOlyver, if it please you."
8829,"olyvarI should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
8830,lorasHow did you know?
8831,olyvarKnow what?
8832,lorasThat I wanted to.
8833,"lorasMy lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."
8834,"olyvarThey rarely do, in my experience."
8835,"lorasYou have a good deal of experience, do you?"
8836,olyvarWith the husbands.
8837,petyrThat didn't take long.
8838,"olyvarWell, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed."
8839,petyrIs he? And who's the lucky girl?
8840,"petyrShe may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
8841,sansaWhat is?
8842,"petyrIt doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
8843,sansaIs it?
8844,petyrLady Margaery wears it that way.
8845,sansaMany ladies wear it this way.
8846,petyrI have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
8847,sansaYou still want me to come with you?
8848,"petyrIt's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
8849,"sansaOf course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
8850,"petyrI hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
8851,"sansaI do, Lord Baelish."
8852,petyrPetyr.
8853,sansaPetyr.
8854,"petyrIf you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
8855,petyrWe'll speak again when I return.
8856,tywinYou're late.
8857,tyrionWhat's she doing here?
8858,"tywinOur business concerns her, too. Sit."
8859,"tyrionYou'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
8860,tywinNever mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
8861,tyrionI'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
8862,tyrionStop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
8863,tywinYour sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
8864,"tyrionVery well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
8865,tywinYour jokes are not appreciated.
8866,"tyrionIt wasn't my best, but-"
8867,"tywinI bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
8868,tyrionSansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
8869,tywinThe Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
8870,tyrionThe Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
8871,tywinThere's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
8872,tyrionAnd how do we do that?
8873,tywinWe find Sansa Stark a different husband.
8874,tyrionWonderful.
8875,"cerseiYes, it is."
8876,tyrionYou can't mean it.
8877,tywinI can and I do.
8878,tyrionJoffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
8879,"tywinDo you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
8880,tyrionShe's a child!
8881,"cerseiShe's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
8882,"tywinThere, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
8883,tyrionAnd if I refuse?
8884,tywinYou wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
8885,tyrionI was wed. Or don't you remember?
8886,tywinOnly too well.
8887,cerseiYou should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
8888,tywinTyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
8889,cerseiWhat do you mean?
8890,tywinYou'll marry Ser Loras.
8891,cerseiI will not.
8892,"tywinThe boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
8893,"cerseiNo, I won't do it."
8894,"tywinYes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
8895,"cerseiI am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
8896,tywinYou're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
8897,"cerseiFather, don't make me do it again, please."
8898,tywinNot another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
8899,"shireenIt's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay."
8900,gillyYou've got too much wood in there.
8901,"samBut the more wood, the bigger the fire."
8902,gillyIt needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
8903,samHuh. You know your fires.
8904,gillySomeone built your fires for you growing up?
8905,"samIt doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
8906,gillyI knew you were highborn.
8907,"samOh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
8908,gillyWhat does it do?
8909,"samI'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
8910,gillyHow much longer?
8911,samNot so far. A few more days.
8912,gillyIs the Wall as big as they say?
8913,samBigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
8914,gillyYou're playing with me.
8915,"samI'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
8916,gillyDo you sing?
8917,"samNo. No, no, no. Not very well."
8918,gillySing me a song.
8919,"samOh, all right. Let's see."
8920,"samOh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
8921,oshaThat's not how you skin a rabbit.
8922,meeraI know how to skin a rabbit.
8923,oshaNot by the looks of it.
8924,"oshaYou grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
8925,meeraI didn't see any game before I got here.
8926,"oshaIf I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
8927,"meeraWell, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
8928,"oshaYou learn how to use your fists, though."
8929,"meeraOh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
8930,oshaI had someone else in mind.
8931,"meeraWell, someone else is sitting right here."
8932,branYou're both very good at skinning rabbits.
8933,oshaSome of us are just a little better.
8934,"meeraWell, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
8935,"oshaYou've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
8936,branStop it!
8937,hodorHodor.
8938,branYou've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
8939,"oshaLady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground."
8940,branYou've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
8941,"oshaMe? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
8942,"branFirst time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
8943,meeraYour way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
8944,"oshaI said so, didn't I?"
8945,branOsha!
8946,oshaYou're a good little hunter.
8947,"meeraThank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you."
8948,oshaDon't push me.
8949,meeraShh. I'm right here with you.
8950,rickonWhat's happening?
8951,meeraI'm right here with you.
8952,rickonWhat's wrong with him?
8953,meeraThe visions take their toll.
8954,branHe's having one now?
8955,jojenI saw Jon Snow.
8956,branYou saw him? At Castle Black?
8957,jojenHe was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
8958,tormundUsed to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
8959,orellYour flock gets smaller every year.
8960,jonYou ever climbed it before?
8961,ygritteNo. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
8962,jonAren't you?
8963,"ygritteAye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
8964,"ygritteI brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
8965,jonYou kill someone for them?
8966,"ygritteNah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
8967,ygritteHe wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
8968,jonCan we not talk about that here?
8969,"ygritteCan we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
8970,jonDid I seem scared the other day?
8971,ygritteYou were trembling like a leaf.
8972,jonOnly in the beginning.
8973,"ygritteOnly in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
8974,jonWhat secret?
8975,ygritteDo you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
8976,"ygritteBut I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
8977,ygritteIt's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
8978,jonI won't.
8979,ygritteCause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
8980,"tormundSink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
8981,aryaJoffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
8982,anguyYou're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
8983,"aryaFace, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
8984,"anguyAye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
8985,anguyKeep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
8986,aryaWhat?
8987,anguyYour muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
8988,aryaBut I have to aim.
8989,anguyNever aim.
8990,aryaNever aim?
8991,anguyYour eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
8992,aryaThere's someone out there.
8993,anguyThat's about far enough.
8994,melisandreWe come as friends.
8995,"anguyBegging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
8996,melisandreValar morghulis.
8997,thorosValar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
8998,melisandreYou are Thoros of Myr.
8999,melisandreThe High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
9000,thorosI failed.
9001,"melisandreYou quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
9002,"thorosYou worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
9003,"thorosMy friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
9004,bericForgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
9005,thorosLucky for the ladies.
9006,melisandreHow many times has the Lord brought him back?
9007,thorosSix.
9008,melisandreThat's not possible.
9009,thorosThe Lord has smiled upon me.
9010,melisandreYou should not have this power.
9011,"thorosI have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
9012,"thorosI've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9013,melisandreYou've been to the other side.
9014,"bericThe other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
9015,melisandreYou have someone He needs.
9016,anguyBodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
9017,"gendryYeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
9018,anguyI'll get you the steel.
9019,manCome on.
9020,aryaI don't like that woman.
9021,anguyThat's 'cause you're a girl.
9022,aryaWhat does that have to do with anything?
9023,"bericForgive me, lad."
9024,aryaWhat are you doing? Let go of him.
9025,aryaTell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
9026,bericWe serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
9027,aryaDid the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
9028,aryaYou're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
9029,"thorosWe're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
9030,gendryYou told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9031,melisandreYou are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
9032,aryaYou're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
9033,"melisandreI see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
9034,"ygritteYou staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
9035,tormundLook out!
9036,ygritteYou all right?
9037,"tormundJust seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
9038,ramsaySorry. Were you sleeping?
9039,theonWa-
9040,ramsayWa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
9041,ramsaySo let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9042,theonPlease.
9043,ramsayPlease is not a body part.
9044,"theonI'll tell you everything, please."
9045,"ramsayBut you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9046,"ramsayNow how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
9047,"ramsayYou've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9048,"theonIf I win, you'll let me go?"
9049,"ramsayIf you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
9050,ramsayYou say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9051,theonThe North.
9052,ramsayToo vague.
9053,theonDeepwood Motte.
9054,ramsayTerrible guess.
9055,"ramsayNow, where?"
9056,theonLast Hearth.
9057,ramsayDo I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9058,theonKarhold!
9059,ramsayKarhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9060,theonNo. It was just a guess.
9061,"ramsayVery good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9062,theonTorrhen Karstark.
9063,ramsayHe's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
9064,theonHe was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
9065,theonYou swore to tell me if I-
9066,ramsayYou're right.
9067,theonLord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
9068,ramsayYes. You win.
9069,"ramsayOf course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
9070,ramsayI'm afraid I am.
9071,ramsayEverything I told you is a lie.
9072,"ramsayThis isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
9073,"theonPlease, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
9074,ramsayI win.
9075,robbThank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
9076,"blackThe roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
9077,lotharOur father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9078,robbOf course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9079,"blackAs restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9080,edmureI don't think that's-
9081,robbWe are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9082,blackAnd there's something else.
9083,robbWe will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9084,"blackNot what, whom."
9085,edmureWhat?
9086,edmureNo.
9087,lotharOur father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9088,edmureHow old is she?
9089,lotharNineteen.
9090,edmureCould I see her first?
9091,blackYou want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9092,bryndenYour father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9093,lotharFather is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9094,blackAnd his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9095,robbHe has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9096,"edmureWhy should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9097,robbHe's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9098,edmureI didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9099,bryndenListen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9100,edmureThe laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9101,bryndenThe laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9102,"robbIt's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9103,"edmureHe's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9104,catelynYou're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9105,robbI have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9106,bryndenYou recall that heroic engagement?
9107,edmureI had something less permanent in mind.
9108,"robbI've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9109,edmureI'll marry her.
9110,"robbYou're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9111,rooseI see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9112,"brienneYes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9113,"rooseWhen King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9114,rooseI should send you back to Robb Stark.
9115,"jaimeYou should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9116,rooseWars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9117,jaimeWe both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9118,rooseYou're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9119,"jaimeIt would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9120,rooseKing Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9121,jaimeHe'll make time for you.
9122,"rooseAs soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9123,jaimeShall we drink on it?
9124,rooseI don't partake.
9125,jaimeYou do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9126,"jaimeVery well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9127,"rooseOh, she won't be going with you."
9128,brienneI am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9129,rooseYou are charged with abetting treason.
9130,jaimeI'm afraid I must insist.
9131,rooseYou're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9132,olennaImpossible.
9133,tywinWhy?
9134,olennaMy grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9135,"tywinIs rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9136,olennaOld.
9137,tywinOld?
9138,"olennaOld. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9139,"tywinThe years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9140,"olennaOh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9141,tywinAnd a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9142,"olennaDid you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9143,tywinOf course.
9144,olennaAnd you never-
9145,tywinNo.
9146,olennaNot once? Not in any way?
9147,tywinNever.
9148,"olennaI congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9149,tywinPerhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9150,"olennaI wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9151,tywinI will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9152,"olennaLie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9153,tywinI don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9154,"olennaAs an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9155,"tywinNow, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9156,"olennaAnd if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9157,tywinThe uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9158,"tywinIf you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9159,olennaOh
9160,tywinThe Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9161,olennaYou would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9162,"tywinI would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9163,olennaIt's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9164,orellNo!
9165,orellWe've gotta cut them loose!
9166,tormundNo!
9167,jonTake my hand!
9168,sansaThat's a wonderful pin.
9169,"lorasOh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9170,sansaI'm very happy about
9171,"lorasUh, yes. I-I am as well."
9172,sansaI feel like I'm in a dream.
9173,"lorasYes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9174,sansaNo. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9175,"lorasIt's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9176,tyrionI don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9177,cerseiWe can have them both killed.
9178,tyrionIt's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9179,cerseiFather doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9180,tyrionOn a boat you built.
9181,cerseiThe Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9182,tyrionI'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9183,"cerseiI do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9184,tyrionTrying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9185,"tyrionThe impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9186,cerseiWhat do you want me to say?
9187,tyrionI want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9188,cerseiProbably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9189,tyrionSeven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9190,"cerseiNot the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9191,"tyrionYou may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9192,"cerseiWhen Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9193,"tyrionJaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9194,cerseiWho's going to tell her?
9195,sansaDo you think people will like it?
9196,shaeI don't think they will even notice it.
9197,"sansaYou're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9198,shaeI'm sure he does.
9199,sansaWill they let me invite my family?
9200,shaeThey haven't asked my opinion.
9201,sansaBut do you think they will?
9202,shaeNo.
9203,"maidLady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9204,"tyrionI beg your pardon, my lady."
9205,"sansaGood afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9206,"tyrionYes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9207,sansaOf course.
9208,"tyrionAlone, if I may."
9209,shaeWhy do you need to speak to her alone?
9210,"sansaShae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9211,tyrionSometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9212,"sansaIt's all right, really."
9213,tyrionHow to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9214,"varysA thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9215,petyrThere aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9216,"varysHa, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9217,"petyrEarly days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9218,"varysThwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9219,"petyrYou're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9220,varysI did what I did for the good of the realm.
9221,petyrThe realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9222,varysBut what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9223,petyrChaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9224,petyrMany who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9225,"petyrAnd some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
9226,ygritteHow far are we?
9227,"jonAbout a week, I think."
9228,ygritteYou think? You don't know?
9229,"jonWhen we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9230,ygritteYou and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9231,"jonMost of the time, yes."
9232,ygritteHow do the men holding the banners fight?
9233,"jonThey don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9234,"ygritteAnd the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9235,jonUsually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9236,ygritteSo what good are they?
9237,jonThey help the men march.
9238,ygritteHow?
9239,"jonWell, it's- it's the rhythm."
9240,"ygritteOh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9241,"jonNo. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
9242,"ygritteYou know nothing, Jon Snow."
9243,"orellShe's right, you don't."
9244,jonI know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9245,"orellCut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9246,jonAnd are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9247,"orellPeople work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
9248,bryndenThat rain will cost us another day.
9249,robbFrey will wait. He knows we're coming.
9250,catelynLord Walder is prickly by nature.
9251,bryndenPrickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
9252,"catelynYes, and that is why-"
9253,"bryndenI've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
9254,"talisaI've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
9255,catelynLord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
9256,edmureHe can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
9257,catelynHe's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9258,robbEdmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
9259,"robbIf you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
9260,talisaAttack. Attack.
9261,robbWho are you writing?
9262,talisaMy mother.
9263,robbIs that Valyrian?
9264,talisaGaaa.
9265,robbGaaa? Say hello for me.
9266,talisaRytsas.
9267,robbRitsas.
9268,talisaThat was close enough.
9269,robbDoes she know her daughter's a queen?
9270,talisaNot yet.
9271,"robbThat will be a surprise, I expect."
9272,talisaMany surprises for her.
9273,robbHow am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
9274,talisaWill you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9275,robbI will.
9276,talisaI promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
9277,"robbWhat, now? Are you certain?"
9278,talisaAre you angry with me?
9279,robbAngry? You're my queen.
9280,talisaAnd I have your little prince or princess inside me.
9281,robbMaybe one of each.
9282,talisaDon't get greedy.
9283,talisaCan you leave the war for one night?
9284,robbI love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
9285,tormundMost men fuck like dogs.
9286,"tormundNo grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on."
9287,"orellYou think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
9288,"ygritteNo, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
9289,"orellI've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
9290,"ygritteWhat, you're jealous?"
9291,orellOf course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
9292,ygritteAnd you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
9293,orellYou would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
9294,orellCause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
9295,ygritteDon't touch me.
9296,orellYou won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
9297,"sansaGrowing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
9298,margaeryCome on. Come walk with me.
9299,"margaeryI remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
9300,margaeryYou would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
9301,sansaHow do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
9302,margaeryHas Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
9303,sansaNo.
9304,margaeryHas he been kind to you?
9305,sansaHe's tried.
9306,"margaeryYou don't want him, though."
9307,sansaHe's a Lannister.
9308,"margaeryFar from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
9309,sansaI'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
9310,"margaeryMy son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
9311,sansaMy son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
9312,margaeryIf it's the pain you're worried about-
9313,sansaI'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
9314,"margaeryWhat is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
9315,sansaHe's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
9316,"margaerySome women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
9317,sansaAnd that's a good thing?
9318,"margaeryIt can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
9319,sansaHow do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
9320,"margaeryYes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
9321,tyrionShe's a child.
9322,bronnShe's a foot taller than you.
9323,tyrionA tall child.
9324,bronnWhat's the youngest you've ever had?
9325,tyrionNot that young.
9326,bronnHow much older?
9327,tyrionOlder.
9328,"bronnYou're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
9329,tyrionShae isn't going to like it.
9330,bronnShae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
9331,tyrionI should never have told you about that.
9332,"bronnYou want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
9333,tyrionTwo women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
9334,"bronnYou waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
9335,tyrionI don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
9336,bronnYou pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
9337,tywinYour Grace.
9338,joffreyGrandfather.
9339,tywinYou wanted to speak to me?
9340,joffreyYes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
9341,"tywinYou're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9342,joffreyI've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9343,tywinOf course.
9344,joffreyYou've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9345,"tywinI have, yes."
9346,joffreyMay I ask why?
9347,"tywinThe Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9348,"joffreySo if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9349,tywinWe could arrange to have you carried.
9350,joffreyTell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9351,tywinWhere did you hear about this?
9352,joffreyIs it true?
9353,tywinApparently so.
9354,joffreyDon't you think we ought to do something about it?
9355,"tywinWhen I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9356,joffreyAnd the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9357,"tywinYes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9358,joffreyBut how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9359,tywinBecause we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9360,joffreyBut I haven't been counseled.
9361,tywinYou are being counseled at this very moment.
9362,joffreyI should be consulted about such things.
9363,"tywinFrom now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
9364,jorahYunkai. The Yellow City.
9365,"barristanThe Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
9366,"jorahOn the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
9367,daenerysI don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
9368,"jorahWe don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
9369,daenerysHow many slaves are there in Yunkai?
9370,jorahTwo hundred thousand if not more.
9371,daenerysThen we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
9372,"daenerysSend a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
9373,"missandeiNow comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
9374,"missandeiNoble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
9375,daenerysYou may approach. Sit.
9376,missandeiWill the noble lord take refreshment?
9377,"radzalAncient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
9378,daenerysGood. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
9379,"radzalIf blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
9380,radzalThe wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
9381,radzalThere is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
9382,daenerysMy ship?
9383,"radzalYes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
9384,daenerysAnd what do you ask in return?
9385,radzalAll we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
9386,daenerysI have a gift for you as well. Your life.
9387,radzalMy life?
9388,"daenerysAnd the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
9389,"radzalYou are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
9390,radzalYou swore me safe conduct.
9391,"daenerysI did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
9392,radzalTake the gold.
9393,"daenerysMy gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
9394,barristanThe Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
9395,daenerysAnd what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
9396,jorahI don't know.
9397,daenerysFind out.
9398,shaeChains?
9399,tyrionSolid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
9400,shaeGolden chains.
9401,tyrionYou could buy a ship with these.
9402,shaeDo I need a ship?
9403,tyrionWhat?
9404,shaeAm I going somewhere?
9405,tyrionOf course you're not going anywhere.
9406,"shaeSo, am I invited to your wedding?"
9407,tyrionI didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
9408,shaeNo? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
9409,"tyrionThat doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
9410,shaeIs that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
9411,tyrionI don't have a choice. My father-
9412,shaeDoes not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
9413,tyrionWhat would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
9414,shaeAnd I'm Shae the funny whore.
9415,tyrionMy feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
9416,shaeWhile I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
9417,tyrionI swear to you it will not be like that.
9418,shaeNo? What will it be like?
9419,"tyrionI will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
9420,shaeChildren? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
9421,"tyrionListen. Listen to me, my lady."
9422,shaeI'm not your lady.
9423,tyrionYou are. You'll always be my lady.
9424,"shaeI'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
9425,gendryWhat happened?
9426,melisandreWildfire. I should have been here.
9427,"gendryAfter all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started."
9428,melisandreDo you miss it?
9429,gendryKing's Landing?
9430,melisandreYour father's house.
9431,gendryNever had a father. Never wanted one.
9432,melisandreHaven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
9433,gendryI'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
9434,"melisandreMine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
9435,gendryI was born in Flea Bottom.
9436,melisandreYour blood is noble.
9437,"gendryAre you saying my father, he was some lord or-"
9438,melisandreThere. Your father's house.
9439,gendryI'm just a bastard.
9440,"melisandreThe bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
9441,"bericCome sit by the fire, child."
9442,"thorosNot talking, eh? That's a first."
9443,aryaI don't talk to traitors.
9444,bericI didn't like giving up the boy.
9445,aryaBut you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
9446,"bericThe Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey."
9447,aryaHe's not my one true god.
9448,bericNo? Who's yours?
9449,aryaDeath.
9450,anguySpotted a Lannister raiding party.
9451,bericHow many?
9452,anguyNo more than twenty.
9453,bericHow far?
9454,anguyLess than a day's ride south.
9455,"thorosWhat do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
9456,menYeah!
9457,aryaBut what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
9458,thorosIt will still be west of here two days from now.
9459,aryaYou swore.
9460,"bericTo take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first."
9461,aryaWhy? So you can steal their gold?
9462,"bericI swear to you, this isn't-"
9463,"aryaI don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
9464,"bericOne day you'll understand, but now-"
9465,"bericAnguy, bring her back."
9466,"manCome back, girl!"
9467,"sandorKick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good."
9468,brienneI thought you were gone.
9469,jaimeTomorrow.
9470,brienneHave they told you what they plan to do with me?
9471,jaimeLord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
9472,brienneWith Locke?
9473,jaimeI owe you a debt.
9474,"brienneWhen Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."
9475,jaimeI will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
9476,"brienneGood-bye, Ser Jaime."
9477,qyburnHere. Let me.
9478,qyburnIt will take time.
9479,rooseQyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
9480,jaimeMy father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
9481,"rooseYou will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?"
9482,jaimeTell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
9483,"lockeSafe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her."
9484,myrandaShh.
9485,"violetGentle, my lord. Gentle."
9486,"violetShh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only she had other urges."
9487,"myrandaSo did the septons, only they lied about it."
9488,theonWhere is he?
9489,"violetWho, my lord?"
9490,"myrandaThere's no one here but you, me, and Violet."
9491,theonPlease.
9492,violetDon't you want us to see it?
9493,"myrandaOh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it."
9494,theonHe sent you.
9495,myrandaWho sent us?
9496,"violetWe sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy."
9497,myrandaWe heard so much about it.
9498,violetOh! There it is.
9499,violetOh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
9500,"myrandaWell, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
9501,theonHelp me. If he comes back-
9502,violetWe need to make him feel better.
9503,myrandaAnd how can we make him feel better?
9504,violetI have an idea.
9505,"violetOh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
9506,myrandaMaybe he doesn't know how we are.
9507,"myrandaOh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
9508,violetAs good as they say?
9509,myrandaMmm.
9510,violetAnd why should you get all the fun?
9511,myrandaWhat? You like her better?
9512,violetPlenty there for both of us.
9513,myrandaI was here first.
9514,ramsayI'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
9515,ramsayBut I was getting jealous.
9516,ramsayWell? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
9517,ramsayEveryone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
9518,ramsayYour famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
9519,"theonPlease. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
9520,ramsayThis is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
9521,"theonNo! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
9522,jonYou're gonna scare it off.
9523,ygritteI'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
9524,jonIt's too far away.
9525,ygritteIs that a palace?
9526,jonIt's a windmill.
9527,ygritteWindmill. Who built it? Some king?
9528,jonJust the men who used to live here.
9529,"ygritteThey must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
9530,jonWinterfell has towers three times that size.
9531,ygritteI'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
9532,"jonIf you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
9533,ygritteWhat's swooning?
9534,jonFainting.
9535,ygritteWhat's fainting?
9536,jonWhen a girl sees blood and collapses.
9537,ygritteWhy would a girl see blood and collapse?
9538,jonWell not all girls are like you.
9539,"ygritteWell, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
9540,ygritteMy dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
9541,jonI'd like to see you in a silk dress.
9542,ygritteWould you?
9543,jonSo I could tear it off you.
9544,"ygritteWell, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
9545,jonMaybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
9546,ygritteOr maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
9547,"jonYgritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
9548,ygritteYou know nothing-
9549,"jonSix times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
9550,ygritteAnd how do you know that?
9551,"jonEvery boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
9552,ygritteMance is different.
9553,jonYou don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
9554,ygritteYou don't know that.
9555,"jonI do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
9556,ygritteAll of us.
9557,"ygritteYou're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
9558,"jonYes, first we'll live."
9559,oshaWhat's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
9560,hodorHodor.
9561,jojenThat's where we are.
9562,oshaWhat are you telling him?
9563,"branIt's all right, Osha."
9564,oshaIt's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
9565,meeraLeave him alone.
9566,oshaHe can speak for himself.
9567,jojenI don't fill his head with anything.
9568,oshaSo what do you talk about?
9569,jojenWhat's happening to him and what that means.
9570,"oshaGo on, then. Tell us what it means."
9571,jojenIt's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
9572,oshaI don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
9573,jojenWe're not going to Castle Black.
9574,oshaWhat did you say?
9575,jojenI told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
9576,"oshaOh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
9577,branThe raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
9578,oshaYou have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
9579,branWhat if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
9580,"oshaIs that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
9581,branYou don't understand. You don't know.
9582,"oshaYou don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
9583,"oshaI knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
9584,"qyburnHow is the pain, my lord?"
9585,jaimeWhat's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
9586,"qyburnWell, we've stymied the corruption."
9587,"jaimeYes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
9588,qyburnAll the good it's done me.
9589,jaimeYou did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
9590,"qyburnFaint praise, my lord."
9591,jaimeSo why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
9592,"qyburnNo, my lord. That's not my weakness."
9593,jaimeWhat is?
9594,qyburnCuriosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
9595,jaimeYou performed experiments on living men.
9596,qyburnOn dying men.
9597,jaimeWith their permission?
9598,qyburnMy studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
9599,"jaimeDying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
9600,"qyburnHow many men have you killed, my lord?"
9601,jaimeI don't know.
9602,qyburnFifty? A hundred?
9603,qyburnCountless.
9604,jaimeCountless has a nice ring to it.
9605,qyburnAnd how many lives have you saved?
9606,jaimeHalf a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
9607,qyburnA bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
9608,jaimeA fair offer.
9609,qyburnA fair offer. Locke won't take it.
9610,jaimeWhy not?
9611,qyburnHe's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
9612,qyburnHe feels he's being cheated.
9613,jaimeThey'd be fools to kill her.
9614,"qyburnThese men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
9615,jaimeWe have to return to Harrenhal.
9616,steelshanksWhy?
9617,jaimeI've left something behind.
9618,steelshanksAbsolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
9619,jaimeAnd what are those orders?
9620,steelshanksTo deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
9621,jaimeYou think you'll get a reward.
9622,steelshanksI serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
9623,"jaimeYou think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
9624,steelshanksI had nothing-
9625,jaimeOr I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
9626,jaimeWhoa.
9627,"steelshanksEyes open, lads."
9628,jaimeBe quiet.
9629,"menThe bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
9630,manDon't spare her. Don't spare her!
9631,"lockeWell, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
9632,jaimeA wooden sword?
9633,lockeI thought you'd gone.
9634,jaimeYou gave her a wooden sword.
9635,lockeWe've only got one bear.
9636,"jaimeI'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
9637,lockeAll you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
9638,lockeThis makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
9639,brienneAh!
9640,jaimeGet behind me.
9641,brienneI will not.
9642,lockeWhat the fuck are you doing to my bear?
9643,steelshanksLord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
9644,jaimePull her up.
9645,brienneHold my legs.
9646,briennePull him up!
9647,lockeThe bitch stays.
9648,jaimeWe're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
9649,lockeShe belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
9650,jaimeWhat do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
9651,"jaimeWell, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
9652,"sandorI'll give you one try, girl."
9653,"sandorKill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
9654,"sandorSulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
9655,aryaThere's no one worse than you.
9656,"sandorHa, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
9657,aryaYou're lying.
9658,"sandorAsk her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
9659,aryaIs that the Blackwater?
9660,sandorThe Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
9661,aryaBack to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
9662,sandorFuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
9663,aryaBut why?
9664,sandorBecause your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
9665,aryaWhy would they be at the Twins?
9666,sandorThose outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
9667,barristanMen who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
9668,jorahThey can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
9669,daenerysYou know these men?
9670,"jorahOnly by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
9671,daenerysIs he more titan or bastard?
9672,"jorahHe's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
9673,daenerysHow many?
9674,"barristanTwo thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
9675,daenerysEnough to make a difference?
9676,daenerysIt's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
9677,jorahI imagine you're right.
9678,daenerysI'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
9679,jorahHe may not agree to meet.
9680,daenerysHe will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
9681,"barristanYour Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
9682,daarioDaario Naharis
9683,meroYou are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
9684,jorahMind your tongue.
9685,meroWhy? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
9686,"meroYou, slave girl, bring wine."
9687,daenerysWe have no slaves here.
9688,meroYou'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
9689,"daenerysGive me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
9690,"barristanUnder two thousand, Your Grace."
9691,"daenerysWe have more, don't we?"
9692,barristanTen thousand Unsullied.
9693,"daenerysI'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
9694,daarioI hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
9695,daenerysYou're very young to be a captain.
9696,prendahlHe's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
9697,"daenerysEven if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
9698,meroThe Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
9699,jorahThe Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
9700,daenerysOr you could fight for me.
9701,meroWe've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
9702,daenerysI would pay you as much and more.
9703,"prendahlOur contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
9704,daenerysRide with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
9705,daarioYou have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
9706,"daenerysA fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
9707,meroShow me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
9708,"greyMy Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
9709,daenerysThese men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
9710,meroOnly a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
9711,"daenerysA barrel, then."
9712,"meroGood. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
9713,meroI'll come looking for you when this is over.
9714,"daenerysSer Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
9715,"barristanGladly, Your Grace."
9716,"stannisHalf Robert, half lowborn."
9717,melisandreShow the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
9718,stannisWhat do you mean to do with him?
9719,melisandreYou know what I mean to do with him.
9720,"stannisThen why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
9721,"melisandreHave you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
9722,stannisNo.
9723,"melisandreIf the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
9724,stannisYou've slaughtered many lambs?
9725,melisandreAnd none have seen the blade.
9726,"davosAnd tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
9727,davosYour Grace.
9728,stannisThey feeding you enough?
9729,"davosTwo meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
9730,stannisYou don't belong in a place like this.
9731,"davosWell, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
9732,stannisYeah.
9733,davosI'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
9734,stannisMelisandre's returned.
9735,davosI didn't know she'd been gone.
9736,stannisCame back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
9737,davosWhy?
9738,stannisShe says there's power in king's blood.
9739,davosShe's going to kill him.
9740,stannisSacrifice him.
9741,"davosForgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
9742,stannisWhat of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
9743,davosBecause he has your blood in his veins.
9744,stannisSo did Renly.
9745,"davosRenly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
9746,"stannisHow many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
9747,"davosYour Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
9748,stannisI came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
9749,davosI swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
9750,stannisYou have little regard for your own life.
9751,"davosQuite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
9752,"stannisI saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
9753,prendahlLittle dragon bitch. She talks too much.
9754,daarioYou talk too much.
9755,meroShe won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
9756,daarioEight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
9757,meroMy cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
9758,daarioShe'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
9759,"meroDaario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
9760,"daarioI like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
9761,meroShe sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
9762,daarioI fight for beauty.
9763,prendahlFor beauty?
9764,meroWe fight for gold.
9765,daarioThe gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
9766,meroYou'll die young.
9767,prendahlWhat do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
9768,meroThere won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
9769,prendahlShe's well guarded.
9770,meroTonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
9771,prendahlWhich one of us?
9772,"meroClose your eyes, love."
9773,"meroThree coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
9774,daarioDo you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
9775,daarioYou have something for me?
9776,daarioValar morghulis.
9777,tyrionLady Sansa.
9778,"sansaYou look very handsome, my lord."
9779,"tyrionOh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
9780,"tyrionMy lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
9781,"sansaI hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
9782,"tyrionNo, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
9783,"sansaI doubt that very much, my lord."
9784,tyrionYou're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
9785,"tyrionBut I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
9786,sansaWhen I have to.
9787,"tyrionWell, today you have to."
9788,"margaeryYou look radiant, Your Grace."
9789,cerseiRadiant? Why radiant?
9790,margaeryIt's the word that came to mind.
9791,margaeryWe're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
9792,"cerseiYou're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
9793,"margaeryA better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
9794,"cerseiAh, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
9795,margaeryOf course. They play it so often here at court.
9796,cerseiSo you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
9797,"margaeryNot as well as you, I'm sure."
9798,cerseiHouse Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
9799,"cerseiOf course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
9800,margaeryGone.
9801,"cerseiGone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
9802,"cerseiI remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
9803,"cerseiIf you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
9804,sansaWhat are you doing?
9805,"joffreyYour father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
9806,septonYou may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
9807,tyrionCould you-
9808,tyrionThank you.
9809,"septonYour Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
9810,melisandreHave you ever seen one like it?
9811,gendryI've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
9812,"melisandreIt's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
9813,gendryIn Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
9814,"melisandreHere, taste this."
9815,melisandreYou think I'm trying to poison you?
9816,gendryThat's good.
9817,gendryThat's really good.
9818,melisandreWhere do you think it's from?
9819,gendryI couldn't even guess.
9820,"melisandreDoesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
9821,"gendryThat thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
9822,melisandreThere are no mistakes. Not for us.
9823,gendryI'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
9824,"melisandreYour father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
9825,gendryI don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
9826,"melisandreAccording to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
9827,"melisandreDeath is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
9828,melisandreLet me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
9829,gendryWhat are you doing?
9830,melisandreYou have to trust me.
9831,gendryWhat-? Get it away. Get it off me.
9832,"melisandreDon't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
9833,gendryWhy are you doing this?
9834,melisandreI told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
9835,"gendryNo. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
9836,melisandreYou can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
9837,"gendryPlease. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
9838,stannisThe usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
9839,"olennaSo their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
9840,"sansaWill you pardon me, my lord?"
9841,tyrionOf course. Of course. En-enjoy.
9842,cerseiPerhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
9843,joffreyI've got a lifetime for that.
9844,cerseiStay.
9845,tywinYou seem rather drunk.
9846,tyrionRather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
9847,"tywinThis isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
9848,tyrionAnd?
9849,"tywinIf you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
9850,tyrionWhat did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
9851,tywinMore than once.
9852,"tyrionThere you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
9853,"tywinYou can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
9854,"lorasWell, my father once told me-"
9855,cerseiNobody cares what your father once told you.
9856,"joffreyCongratulations, my lady."
9857,"sansaThank you, Your Grace."
9858,"joffreyWell, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day."
9859,"sansaYes, Your Grace."
9860,joffreyI suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
9861,joffreyYou wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
9862,joffreyTime for the bedding ceremony.
9863,tyrionThere will be no bedding ceremony.
9864,"joffreyWhere's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
9865,joffreyThere will be if I command it.
9866,tyrionThen you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
9867,joffreyWhat did you say? What did you say?
9868,"tywinI believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
9869,"tyrionA bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
9870,"tywinYour uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
9871,tyrionI am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
9872,"tyrionMy tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
9873,"tyrionI vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
9874,"sansaIs that wise, my lord?"
9875,"tyrionTyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
9876,"sansaIs that wise, Tyrion?"
9877,tyrionNothing was ever wiser.
9878,tyrionAstoundingly long.
9879,sansaWhat?
9880,tyrionNeck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
9881,sansaFourteen.
9882,"tyrionWell, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
9883,"tyrionStop. I can't. I could, I won't."
9884,sansaBut your father-
9885,"tyrionIf my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
9886,sansaWhat if I never want you to?
9887,tyrionAnd so my watch begins.
9888,daenerysNinteen
9889,"missandeiYes, Your Grace."
9890,daenerysHow can anyone speak nineteen languages?
9891,missandeiIt only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
9892,"daenerysYes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
9893,missandeiDothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
9894,daenerysDrogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
9895,missandeiAthjahakar.
9896,daenerysAthjahaka.
9897,missandeiAth-ja-hakar.
9898,daenerysAthjahakar.
9899,"daenerysWell, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
9900,"missandeiYour High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
9901,daarioNo screaming or she dies.
9902,daenerysWhat do you want?
9903,daarioYou.
9904,daenerysLet her go.
9905,"daarioDon't scream, lovely girl."
9906,daenerysYou were sent here to kill me?
9907,daenerysSo why haven't you?
9908,daarioI don't want to.
9909,daenerysWhat do your captains have to say about that?
9910,daarioYou should ask them.
9911,daenerysWhy?
9912,daarioWe had philosophical differences.
9913,daenerysOver what?
9914,daarioYour beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
9915,daenerysYou're a strange man.
9916,daarioI'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
9917,daenerysAnd this is supposed to impress me?
9918,daarioYes.
9919,daenerysWhy would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
9920,daarioThey ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
9921,daenerysWill you fight for me?
9922,daenerysSwear to me.
9923,"daarioThe Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
9924,tyrionYou really ought to knock.
9925,shaeI brought your breakfast.
9926,samIt's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
9927,samHow hard can it be to build a fire?
9928,gillyIt doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
9929,samHe winked at me before.
9930,gillyI doubt it.
9931,samI saw him wink at me.
9932,gillyHe blinked.
9933,samI suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
9934,gillyA what?
9935,"samWell, I mean, there's no real difference."
9936,gillyA wink is on purpose.
9937,samYou thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
9938,gillySometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
9939,samWhat? No. This is just the way I talk.
9940,gillyI'll build that fire.
9941,samDon't you think he should have a name?
9942,gillyI don't know many boys' names.
9943,"samLet's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
9944,gillyCraster.
9945,"samUh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
9946,gillyMormont.
9947,"samThat's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
9948,gillyWhy is it a last name?
9949,"samWell, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
9950,"gillyHis name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
9951,"samNo, Randyll Tarly."
9952,gillyRandyll is a handsome name.
9953,samPlease don't name him Randyll.
9954,gillyIs your father cruel like mine?
9955,samDifferent manner of cruel.
9956,"gillyNot Randyll, then."
9957,gillyDon't. Don't go out there.
9958,samI'll be back. I just want to look.
9959,samGo inside. Go back inside. I'll-
9960,gillyIt's come for the baby.
9961,samStay back!
9962,samYou stay back!
9963,"gillyNo, you can't have him! No!"
9964,gillyNo!
9965,catelynAre you sure about this?
9966,robbNo.
9967,catelynIt's dangerous.
9968,"robbIf we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
9969,catelynWhy are you telling me?
9970,robbYou begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
9971,robbNow Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
9972,"robbSo, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
9973,catelynWe have enough men?
9974,robbIf Walder Frey cooperates.
9975,"catelynIf reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
9976,robbWe'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
9977,catelynShow them how it feels to lose what they love.
9978,"walderMy honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
9979,"robbWe thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
9980,"robbI have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
9981,"walderDon't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
9982,"walderOne of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
9983,"walderThis is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
9984,walderMy eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
9985,"walderSerra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care."
9986,walderMy granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
9987,merryI'm Merry.
9988,"walderFine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
9989,"robbMy ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
9990,walderVery good.
9991,"walderThere she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you."
9992,walderStill can't see you. Old eyes.
9993,"walderLove. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
9994,"walderI can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
9995,walderYour king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
9996,"walderAnd I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
9997,"robbThank you, my lord."
9998,"walderWell, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
9999,daenerysWhere?
10000,daarioThere.
10001,"daarioThere, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10002,jorahYour men but not you?
10003,daarioI have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
10004,"daarioThis is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
10005,barristanWe're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10006,"daarioI kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10007,"daarioThen comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10008,"jorahOr perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10009,"daarioYou have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10010,jorahYou command the Unsullied. What do you think?
10011,"daenerysLo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
10012,greyI trust him.
10013,daenerysYou leave tonight.
10014,jorahVery good. We'll prepare.
10015,barristanSer Jorah. You can use an extra sword.
10016,"jorahYou're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10017,"samWe're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10018,gillyHow do you know all that?
10019,samI read about it in a very old book.
10020,gillyYou know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10021,samYes.
10022,gillyYou're like a wizard.
10023,gillyOur father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
10024,sandorRemember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10025,"pigThe roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10026,sandorNeed a hand?
10027,pigNeed about eight hands.
10028,pigGot to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10029,pigMany thanks.
10030,aryaDon't! Don't kill him.
10031,sandorDead rats don't squeak.
10032,"aryaYou're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
10033,sandorMore than anyone you know.
10034,aryaYou're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
10035,sandorThat so?
10036,aryaYou'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
10037,sandorThat him?
10038,aryaNo.
10039,sandorGood.
10040,aryaDon't kill him! Please. Please don't.
10041,sandorYou're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
10042,oshaWhere are we?
10043,"branThe Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
10044,jojenDoesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
10045,meeraIt's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
10046,branWildlings.
10047,"branSorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10048,rickonOld Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10049,rickonThat's what Old Nan said.
10050,jojenThere's a storm coming.
10051,branI don't see any.
10052,meeraIt's as good a place to shelter as any.
10053,oshaWe can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
10054,orellOnly one old man and eight good horses.
10055,tormundWhat's one old man doing with eight horses?
10056,jonHe breeds them for the Watch.
10057,ygritteHow's he keep folks from stealing them?
10058,jonThe Watch protects him.
10059,"orellNot today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
10060,tormundAnd proper steel.
10061,orellLet's carve him up.
10062,jonWe just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
10063,orellI keep telling you.
10064,ygritteHe's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10065,jonThe Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10066,"tormundI hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
10067,tormundSpread out. Surround the hut and move in.
10068,jonYgritte!
10069,tormundClear the barn!
10070,aryaNo one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
10071,sandorBest part of the animal.
10072,"sandorDon't worry, they're still there."
10073,aryaI know they're still there.
10074,sandorYou check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
10075,aryaI'm not afraid.
10076,"sandorOf course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
10077,aryaI knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
10078,"aryaWhen Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10079,"aryaAnd I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
10080,sandorThat give you some ideas?
10081,aryaMight do.
10082,sandorGo ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
10083,aryaSomeday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
10084,branHow are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
10085,branHow did you get past it?
10086,oshaGot in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10087,branIt would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10088,oshaSome climb straight up the ice.
10089,branEven Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
10090,hodorHodor!
10091,jojenNineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
10092,jojenOne of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10093,branMy uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
10094,"meeraWell, we'll have to open them up again."
10095,"oldWhoa, whoa, whoa!"
10096,meeraThere's a rider out there.
10097,jojenJust one?
10098,meeraThere's more.
10099,"oshaIt's just thunder, sweet giant."
10100,hodorHodor.
10101,oldI yield. I yield.
10102,jojenWildlings.
10103,oshaWhere's Shaggydog and Summer?
10104,branHunting.
10105,"jojenShhh, quiet, Hodor."
10106,jojenMake him shut up. If they hear us…
10107,"branTo Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring."
10108,"branHodor, calm down."
10109,oshaYou need to keep quiet.
10110,jojenThey're gonna hear us.
10111,"branHodor, be quiet."
10112,"branHodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!"
10113,meeraWhat did you do?
10114,branNothing. I don't know.
10115,rickonWhat's That?
10116,oshaThat's a horse dying.
10117,wildlingBring them over here.
10118,wildlingThat was the last of them. The rest are dead.
10119,orellI heard shouting up there.
10120,tormundThunder.
10121,orellI know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10122,tormundMaybe it's ghosts.
10123,"tormundThat won't help you, grandpa."
10124,tormundWhere you riding?
10125,"oldDoesn't matter now, does it?"
10126,"tormundNo, it doesn't matter now."
10127,orellCut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
10128,tormundYou understand.
10129,oldLet me stand at least.
10130,oldLet me go with a bit of dignity.
10131,orellMake the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it.
10132,jojenThe wolves are out there.
10133,branI can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.
10134,"jojenYou're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood."
10135,branI can't.
10136,"jojenYou just did, with him."
10137,jojenA wolf is nothing compared to that.
10138,oldShe looks sharp.
10139,ygritteDo it. Do it.
10140,orellTold ya. He's still one of them.
10141,"tormundGo on, boy."
10142,tormundGo on!
10143,orellHe's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
10144,tormundKill him!
10145,tormundHe's one of them!
10146,ygritteNo!
10147,tormundDo you hear me?
10148,tormundYou're not gonna die for one of them.
10149,jojenDo it. They'll find us if you don't.
10150,jonYou were right the whole time.
10151,"daarioWhen you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
10152,daarioDaario Naharis.
10153,daarioThat one was quick.
10154,jorahThere may be others.
10155,daarioI doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10156,jorahThat's what you call a few guards?
10157,"roslinLord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you."
10158,"edmureYou're a delight to me, my lady."
10159,septonYou may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
10160,"septonIn the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words."
10161,"edmureFather, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
10162,meeraIs that safe?
10163,oshaThey're long gone.
10164,branYou were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
10165,jojenOf course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
10166,branThey can't do that north of the Wall?
10167,jojenNo one can do that. Anywhere.
10168,"branWhen I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon."
10169,rickonWhere?
10170,branHe was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.
10171,oshaHe'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.
10172,"branFor all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-"
10173,oshaI already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.
10174,branEverything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.
10175,"oshaListen to me, little lord."
10176,"branDon't worry, I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon."
10177,rickonMe? I'm coming with you.
10178,branNo. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
10179,rickonI'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.
10180,"branRight now, I have to protect you."
10181,"branRobb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell."
10182,branWill you know how to find the last Hearth?
10183,oshaYou Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
10184,rickonWe're not Southerners.
10185,rickonAnd I don't want to leave you.
10186,"oshaShhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
10187,branYou don't have to do any of this.
10188,"oshaYour family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword."
10189,rickonI know how to swing a sword.
10190,branYou're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
10191,oshaI learned to walk in darkness.
10192,"oshaSay your good-byes, little man."
10193,oshaKeep this one safe. He means the world to me.
10194,"daenerysWe've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
10195,jorahIt was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
10196,daenerysAnd Daario Naharis?
10197,"daarioThe city is yours, my queen."
10198,"talisaThey're good, aren't they?"
10199,lotharThey ought to be because they cost enough.
10200,blackfishLook at the crowd there.
10201,catelynHe complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
10202,blackfishThe Godo s love to reward a fool.
10203,catelynUncle.
10204,"blackfishWhat? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool."
10205,"catelynDon't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
10206,"rooseNever do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
10207,blackfishThat's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
10208,"rooseAye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
10209,catelynI hope she makes you very happy.
10210,"rooseWell, she's made me very rich."
10211,"blackfishPardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
10212,robbMy mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
10213,talisaYour mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
10214,robbBe kind. She's finally starting to like you.
10215,"talisaAnd I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand."
10216,robbPerhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
10217,robbStriking your king is an act of treason.
10218,"talisaNo, don't. Don't insult them."
10219,walderYour Grace.
10220,"walderThe Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?"
10221,everybodyTo bed! To bed! To bed!
10222,"robbIf you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
10223,"edmureHo-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again ."
10224,catelynPoor girl.
10225,rooseEvery bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
10226,"catelynOh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
10227,talisaThat is a very strange custom.
10228,robbI suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
10229,talisaIt seems normal to you?
10230,"robbIt's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10231,"talisaNo, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10232,robbBoy or girl?
10233,"talisaI don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
10234,"robbOh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
10235,talisaEddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10236,robbI do.
10237,"sandorWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
10238,freyWhere are you going?
10239,sandorGot salt pork for the feast.
10240,freyThe feast is over.
10241,sandorIt doesn't sound like it's over.
10242,"freyIf I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here."
10243,"sandorGot pig's feet, too ."
10244,freyAre you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!
10245,walderI feel I've been remiss in my duties.
10246,walderI've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
10247,catelynRobb!
10248,"manYou ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?"
10249,"manFeast over yet, is it?"
10250,"freyAye, it's over!"
10251,sandorIt's too late.
10252,"walderThe King in the North arises, heh heh."
10253,"catelynLord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance."
10254,"walderYou already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!"
10255,"catelynTake me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!"
10256,walderAnd why I would let him do that?
10257,"catelynOn my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
10258,walderI'll find another.
10259,robbMother.
10260,rooseThe Lannisters send their regards.
10261,manIt's too late.
10262,manYah! Yah!
10263,"manGo, move out!"
10264,freyThe King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
10265,freyThe King in the North! The King in the North!
10266,freyHere comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
10267,freyHere comes
10268,tyrionHmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10269,sansaWhat are you doing?
10270,tyrionI have a list.
10271,sansaA list of people you mean to kill?
10272,"tyrionFor laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10273,sansaYou should learn to ignore them.
10274,"tyrionMy lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10275,sansaYou're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10276,tyrionThe disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10277,sansaSo how should we punish them?
10278,tyrionWho? Whom?
10279,sansaSer Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10280,tyrionAh. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10281,sansaI hear that you're a pervert.
10282,tyrionI am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10283,"sansaWe could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10284,tyrionLady Sansa!
10285,sansaMy sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10286,tyrionWhy sheep shift?
10287,sansaThat's the vulgar word for dung.
10288,tyrionMy lady-
10289,"sansaWell, you asked me."
10290,girlOh! That's him!
10291,"podrickMy lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."
10292,tyrionKilled a few puppies today?
10293,"joffreyShow him. Come on, show him."
10294,"pycelleOh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
10295,tyrionRoslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10296,joffreyRobb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10297,"varysYour Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10298,cerseiA joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10299,"joffreyYes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10300,tyrionNo. She is no longer yours to torment.
10301,"joffreyEveryone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10302,"tyrionOh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10303,joffreyI could have your tongue out for saying that.
10304,cerseiLet him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10305,"pycelleLord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10306,joffreyI am the king! I will punish you.
10307,"tywinAny man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10308,joffreyMy father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10309,tywinThe king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10310,cerseiCome along.
10311,joffreyI'm not tired.
10312,cerseiWe have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10313,"tywinGrand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10314,joffreyI'm not tired!
10315,cerseiCome.
10316,tywinNot you.
10317,tyrionYou just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10318,tywinYou're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10319,tyrionA treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10320,tywinYou really think a crown gives you power?
10321,tyrionNo. I think armies give you power.
10322,tywinMm-hmm.
10323,"tyrionRobb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10324,"tyrionOh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10325,tywinWhich he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10326,tyrionI'm all for cheating. This is war.
10327,tywinBut to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10328,tyrionSo that's why you did it? To save lives?
10329,"tywinTo end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10330,tyrionThe Northerners will never forget.
10331,tywinGood. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10332,tywinI believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10333,tyrionDo you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10334,"tywinOne way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10335,tyrionI will not rape her.
10336,tywinShall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10337,tyrionUse small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10338,tywinThe house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10339,tywinDoes that amuse you?
10340,"tyrionNo, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10341,"tywinEasy for me, is it?"
10342,tyrionWhen have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10343,"tywinThe day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10344,tyrionSansa.
10345,meeraIt's empty.
10346,jojenLet's find a place to sleep.
10347,hodorHodor. Hodor.
10348,"branDon't, Hodor."
10349,branMaybe we shouldn't stay.
10350,meeraYou'd rather be out there?
10351,branThere are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10352,jojenI always quite liked the horrible stories.
10353,branSo did I. Once.
10354,branYou ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10355,meeraNo. Who's he?
10356,"branJust a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10357,meeraIf the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
10358,branIt wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10359,"walderThe late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
10360,rooseThe Blackfish escaped.
10361,walderAn old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10362,rooseAs you say.
10363,"walderThey all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10364,rooseYou'll be needing a new young girl.
10365,walderYeah. Got that to look forward to.
10366,"walderAnd you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10367,rooseHe ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
10368,walderCalling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10369,"walderWell, here's to the Young Wolf!"
10370,rooseForever young.
10371,walderWill you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10372,rooseAt some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10373,"walderYeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10374,rooseI sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10375,walderOh. And?
10376,rooseRamsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
10377,"ramsayWell, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10378,ramsayWhat? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10379,ramsayPeople talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10380,"ramsayNext time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10381,ramsaySorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10382,ramsayBut my father taught me to aim for their head.
10383,theonKill me.
10384,"ramsaySorry, what?"
10385,ramsayA little louder.
10386,theonKill me!
10387,ramsayYou're no good to me dead. We need you.
10388,"ramsayYou don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
10389,ramsayStinking meat.
10390,ramsayYou reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
10391,theonTheon Greyjoy.
10392,ramsayWhat's your name?
10393,theonTh- Theon Greyjoy.
10394,theonPlease.
10395,ramsayWhat is your name?!
10396,theonReek. My name is Reek.
10397,branHodor.
10398,samDon't kill me!
10399,meeraWho are you?
10400,gillySam! Sam!
10401,meeraWho are you?!
10402,gillyGilly. Don't hurt us.
10403,jojenWhere are you going?
10404,samTo Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
10405,"branMy brother, he's in the Night's-"
10406,jojenShush.
10407,samWho's your brother?
10408,jojenDoesn't matter.
10409,samYou're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
10410,"branNo, I'm not."
10411,samI've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
10412,hodorHodor.
10413,"samI'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
10414,branTake us north of the Wall.
10415,samWhat? Why in the world would you want to go-
10416,branI don't want to. I have to.
10417,jojenHow did you get through the Wall?
10418,meeraDoes the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10419,samCome with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10420,gillyCome with us. There's nothing north but death.
10421,"samIf Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10422,jojenThere's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10423,"samWhat I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10424,jojenYou saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
10425,samHow do you know all that?
10426,jojenThe Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10427,samBut you're going to stop them?
10428,"branPlease, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
10429,"balonBalon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
10430,"balonOn the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
10431,"balonLeave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
10432,balonTheon disobeyed my orders.
10433,"balonThe boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
10434,yaraHe's your son.
10435,balonSon? He's not a man anymore.
10436,yaraHe's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10437,balonWatch yourself. I've made my decision.
10438,yaraAnd I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10439,yaraI'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
10440,manGet those ropes!
10441,yaraI'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
10442,branWhat is it?
10443,jojenDragonglass.
10444,samWe found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
10445,branWhy? What are they for?
10446,samKilling White Walkers.
10447,meeraHow do you know that?
10448,gillyThe Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
10449,meeraBut no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
10450,"samWell, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10451,"branTake it, Hodor."
10452,"samAnd the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
10453,branI wish I could. I really do.
10454,davosHow are you keeping?
10455,gendryGreat. Never better.
10456,davosIt was just a bit of blood.
10457,"gendryI should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10458,davosI'm not a highborn.
10459,gendryShe called you Ser. I heard it.
10460,davosA recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10461,"gendrySure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10462,davosI lived below the Street of Flour.
10463,gendryHow far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10464,davosThe shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10465,gendryGin Alley.
10466,"davosThe Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
10467,"gendryYeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
10468,"davosIf you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
10469,"gendryYou're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
10470,"davosShe does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10471,gendrySo how'd you become a lord?
10472,"davosOh, that's a long story."
10473,"gendryBetter not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10474,davosMany years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10475,gendryYou see? Highborns.
10476,davosI didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10477,gendryWhy did you?
10478,davosI did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10479,gendryDoes he?
10480,davosHe's dead.
10481,gendryHow'd he die?
10482,davosFollowing me.
10483,varysWhen did you come to this strange country?
10484,shaeWhen I was thirteen.
10485,varysYou were only a child.
10486,shaeI stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10487,"varysYou've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10488,shaeAnd now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10489,varysShe is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10490,shaeI love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10491,"varysNo, I expect not."
10492,shaeShe's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10493,"varysWe break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
10494,shaeI have a name.
10495,varysYou have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
10496,"shaeWhat do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
10497,"varysDiamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
10498,shaeWhy do you want me to leave?
10499,"varysTyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
10500,shaeLord Varys.
10501,"shaeIf he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
10502,tyrionKeep up.
10503,"podrickI don't think I can, my lord."
10504,tyrionIt's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
10505,cerseiLeave.
10506,"cerseiSo, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
10507,tyrionShe doesn't deserve this.
10508,cerseiDeserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
10509,tyrionThere's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
10510,tyrionWill you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10511,cerseiI won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10512,tyrionI seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10513,cerseiYou're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10514,tyrionSo you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10515,cerseiSo she can have some happiness in her life.
10516,tyrionYou have children. How happy would you say you are?
10517,"cerseiNot very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
10518,tyrionEven Joffrey?
10519,"cerseiEven Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
10520,tyrionHow long does it go on?
10521,cerseiUntil we've dealt with all our enemies.
10522,"tyrionEvery time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
10523,cerseiThen I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
10524,"freyI'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat."
10525,"freyAye, not for long."
10526,freyThat's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
10527,"freyI'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
10528,freyYou sewed it on?
10529,freyI did.
10530,freyI bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
10531,"freyIt was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-"
10532,freyWhat do you want?
10533,aryaMind if I keep warm?
10534,freyFuck off.
10535,aryaBut I'm hungry.
10536,freyDoes fuck off mean something different where you're from?
10537,aryaI've got money.
10538,freyWhat kind of coin is that?
10539,aryaIt's worth a lot.
10540,aryaSorry.
10541,freyLittle shit.
10542,freyFool!
10543,sandorWhere did you get the knife?
10544,aryaFrom you.
10545,sandorIs that the first man you've killed?
10546,aryaThe first man.
10547,"sandorNext time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
10548,aryaValar morghulis.
10549,"jonYgritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
10550,jonI have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
10551,"ygritteYou know nothing, Jon Snow."
10552,jonI do know some things. I know I love you.
10553,jonI know you love me. But I have to go home now.
10554,samI know how this must look. What I meant was-
10555,"gillyI swear to you, my lord-"
10556,"maesterI'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?"
10557,gillyGilly.
10558,"maesterAh, for the gillyflower. Lovely."
10559,"gillyYes, my-"
10560,samMaester.
10561,gillyMaster.
10562,maesterAnd the child?
10563,samShe hasn't chosen a name yet.
10564,gillyHis name is Sam.
10565,maesterTarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
10566,"samHe's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
10567,"maesterGilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."
10568,gillyThank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
10569,"maesterGood. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."
10570,samMiles better.
10571,maesterWe had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
10572,davosTo His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-
10573,shireenNight.
10574,davosFirst night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
10575,shireenI don't know. There just is.
10576,"davosWell, your father's not going to go to that."
10577,shireenMy books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
10578,davosI've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
10579,shireenHis fangs were as long as bastard swords.
10580,"davosAye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
10581,shireenNoblemen.
10582,"davosNoblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-"
10583,shireenWhat is it?
10584,shireenWhy are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
10585,davosStay here. Bar the door.
10586,stannisThe usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
10587,davosAnd you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
10588,melisandreI take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
10589,"davosYour Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
10590,"stannisDo you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
10591,davosAegon Targaryen.
10592,stannisAnd do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
10593,"davosOn the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
10594,"stannisHe had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
10595,"davosYou do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
10596,melisandreAnd our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
10597,davosHis name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
10598,stannisWhat is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
10599,davosEverything.
10600,stannisThe boy must die.
10601,gendryWhat are you doing?
10602,davosYou're leaving.
10603,gendryIs this some kind of trick?
10604,"davosYes, but not on you."
10605,"davosAim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
10606,gendryI know not to drink seawater.
10607,davosRow for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
10608,gendryWhere should I go?
10609,davosYou must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
10610,gendryThe gold cloaks are looking for me.
10611,davosThey were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
10612,gendryNo.
10613,davosI'd worry more about the Red Woman.
10614,davosThe other way.
10615,davosYou ever been in a boat before?
10616,gendryYou know how to swim?
10617,davosDon't fall out. Go on.
10618,gendryWhy are you doing this?
10619,davosBecause it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
10620,"davosWhen you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
10621,guardHorse approaching! Halt! Halt!
10622,"samJon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
10623,pypI don't think he can see us.
10624,jonPyp? Sam?
10625,"samHush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
10626,"manOut of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here."
10627,jaimeCersei.
10628,stannisYou don't deny it?
10629,davosNo. I let him go.
10630,melisandreYour mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
10631,"davosAye, I do."
10632,melisandreYou saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
10633,davosThere has got to be another way.
10634,stannisWhat other way?! Tell us about this other way.
10635,"davosI don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
10636,"stannisVery well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
10637,"davosI understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
10638,melisandreTake him away.
10639,stannisWhy am I gonna need you?
10640,melisandreMy king.
10641,"davosIt's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
10642,stannisWhen did you learn to read?
10643,davosMatthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
10644,"melisandreThis War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
10645,"davosYou can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
10646,stannisI've made my decision.
10647,melisandreHe's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
10648,"stannisYou see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
10649,"barristanThey will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
10650,daenerysPerhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
10651,jorahYou didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
10652,daenerysPeople learn to love their chains.
10653,"missandeiThis is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom"
10654,daenerysNo.
10655,"daenerysYou do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
10656,manMhysa!
10657,daughterMhysa!
10658,crowdMhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
10659,daenerysWhat does it mean?
10660,"missandeiIt is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
10661,crowdMhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
10662,daenerysIt's all right. These people won't hurt me.
10663,daenerysFly.
10664,daenerysLet me pass
10665,crowdMhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
10666,jaimeMagnificent.
10667,tywinMm-hmm.
10668,jaimeLooks fresh-forged.
10669,tywinIt is.
10670,jaimeNo one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
10671,tywinThere are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
10672,jaimeWhere did you get this much Valyrian steel?
10673,tywinFrom someone who no longer had need of it.
10674,jaimeYou've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
10675,tywinAnd now we have two.
10676,jaimeTwo?
10677,tywinThe original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
10678,"jaimeWell, thank you. It's glorious."
10679,tywinYou'll have to train your left hand.
10680,jaimeAny decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
10681,tywinYou'll never be as good.
10682,"jaimeNo. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
10683,tywinYou can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
10684,jaimeWhere's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
10685,tywinThe war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
10686,jaimeHow many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
10687,tywinOther knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
10688,jaimeHome?
10689,tywinYou'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
10690,jaimeYou are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
10691,tywinI am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
10692,jaimeYou know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
10693,tywinYou won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
10694,jaimeNo.
10695,tywinNo?
10696,tywinI don't believe I asked you a question.
10697,jaimeThere's my answer.
10698,tywinIf you think your bloody honor comes before...
10699,"jaimeMy bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
10700,tywinWhat do you want?
10701,jaimeSupper would be nice.
10702,"tywinFor 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
10703,jaimeI suppose you want the sword back.
10704,tywinKeep it.
10705,tywinA one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
10706,bronnHow many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
10707,tyrionPlease don't.
10708,"bronnSeems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
10709,"tyrionThis is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
10710,"bronnIf he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
10711,tyrionThere's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
10712,"bronnAnd just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
10713,tyrionNo need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
10714,bronnOh.
10715,"tyrionAh, here we are."
10716,tyrionCan you read the sigils?
10717,bronnYellow balls?
10718,"podrickWild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
10719,tyrionBoy knows his Dornish Houses.
10720,bronnI need a sigil.
10721,"tyrionAnd House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
10722,"podrickI don't see it, my lord."
10723,"tyrionWell met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
10724,dornishThe prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
10725,"tyrionYes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
10726,dornishWill he?
10727,tyrionAnd where is Prince Oberyn?
10728,"dornishArrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
10729,"tyrionVery well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
10730,tyrionYou must be weary after such a long journey.
10731,bronnSome accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
10732,tyrionWe must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
10733,bronnHow do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
10734,"tyrionYou're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
10735,"bronnI'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
10736,oberynLook at this one. How lovely is she?
10737,ellariaBeautiful. But pale.
10738,oberynThey like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
10739,oberynYou like?
10740,ellariaTimid. Timid bores me.
10741,"oberynYou're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
10742,"oberynI think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
10743,"oberynYou're not timid, are you?"
10744,ellariaNot timid.
10745,oberynDo you like women?
10746,"whoreWhen they look like her, my lord."
10747,ellariaThis one will do nicely.
10748,"olyvarVery good, my lady."
10749,"ellariaOh, I'm not a lady."
10750,olyvarA term of courtesy in this establishment.
10751,ellariaA lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
10752,olyvarAny of the others?
10753,oberynThe two girls can leave.
10754,oberynYou stay.
10755,"olyvarI'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
10756,oberynEveryone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
10757,olyvarMy lord.
10758,"oberynI am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
10759,olyvarCan't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
10760,oberynTake off your clothes.
10761,olyvarWhich way do you like it?
10762,oberynMy way .
10763,morganAnd so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains
10764,ellariaOberyn.
10765,morganWeep o'er his hall...
10766,"ellariaOberyn, don't."
10767,"morganWith no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."
10768,"morgansYou lost, friend?"
10769,oberynForgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
10770,morgansI don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
10771,oberynWe don't like the smell.
10772,"ellariaCome with me, lover."
10773,"morganGods, look at this one."
10774,"olyvarSirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
10775,morganWhy are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
10776,oberynDo you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
10777,oberynYou think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
10778,"oberynLongsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
10779,"oberynHe'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
10780,"tyrionPrince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
10781,tyriontrouble.
10782,"oberynApologies, my love."
10783,tyrionI'm here to welcome you to the capital.
10784,"oberynEllaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
10785,tyrionIf there's anything I can do to make your stay...
10786,oberynWhat are you? His hired killer?
10787,"bronnIt started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
10788,oberynHow did that come to pass?
10789,"bronnKilled the right people, I suppose."
10790,"oberynWe'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
10791,"tyrionOh, I partook. Now I'm married."
10792,"tyrionPrince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
10793,oberynSeems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
10794,"tyrionOh, they take all kinds."
10795,oberynEven Dornishmen.
10796,tyrionThe king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
10797,oberynLet us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
10798,"tyrionWell, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
10799,"tyrionWhy did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
10800,oberynI was invited to the royal wedding.
10801,tyrionI thought we were speaking truth.
10802,"oberynThe last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
10803,tyrionI wasn't actually present.
10804,"oberynAnd butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
10805,oberynI'm asking you a question.
10806,tyrionI've heard rumors.
10807,oberynSo have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
10808,tyrionI wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
10809,"oberynIf the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
10810,"jorahThey're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
10811,daenerysSer Barristan.
10812,barristanYour Grace.
10813,daenerysWhere's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
10814,"barristanGambling, Your Grace."
10815,daenerysGambling?
10816,crowdMhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
10817,daenerysHow long have they been at it?
10818,"missandeiSince midnight, Your Grace."
10819,daarioSer Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
10820,daenerysWhat's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
10821,daarioThe honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
10822,daenerysThat honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
10823,daenerysThe last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
10824,daarioYou like this girl? Must be frustrating.
10825,"greyYou are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
10826,daarioI'd rather have no brains and two balls.
10827,shaeYou need to eat something.
10828,shaePigeon pie.
10829,"sansaNo, thank you."
10830,shaeLemon cakes?
10831,shaeYou love lemon cakes.
10832,shaeTell her she needs to eat.
10833,"tyrionMy lady, you do need to eat."
10834,sansaI don't need to eat.
10835,tyrionIf I could have a moment alone with my wife.
10836,shaeShe needs to eat.
10837,tyrionI can't let you starve.
10838,tyrionI swore to protect you.
10839,"tyrionMy lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
10840,sansaHow can you help me?
10841,"tyrionI don't know, but I can try."
10842,sansaI lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
10843,tyrionI could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
10844,sansaDo you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
10845,"tyrionWhat happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
10846,"sansaWill you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
10847,"tyrionOf course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
10848,sansaI don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
10849,shaeMy lion.
10850,tyrionWhat are you doing?
10851,shaeWhat does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
10852,tyrionHow many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
10853,shaeI know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
10854,tyrionOf course I haven't forgotten.
10855,shaeI want you. Don't you want me?
10856,tyrionThings are a bit tense right now.
10857,shaeWhat things?
10858,tyrionMy nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
10859,shaeYou need to relax.
10860,shaeDon't you want to relax?
10861,shaeWhat's wrong?
10862,tyrionI told you. It's not a good time.
10863,shaeIt's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
10864,tyrionShae.
10865,shaeDo you love her?
10866,tyrionLove her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
10867,shaeThat's not an answer.
10868,tyrionOf course I don't love her.
10869,shaeYou tried to ship me away.
10870,tyrionShip you away?
10871,shaeGive me diamonds and make me disappear.
10872,tyrionWhat in the world are you talking about?
10873,"shaeIf you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
10874,tyrionShh. I don't know what you're talking about.
10875,shaeYou want me to stay?
10876,"qyburnA work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
10877,"jaimeYou like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
10878,cerseiSuch an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
10879,jaimeDays?
10880,"cerseiBetter part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
10881,jaimeUh... a hook would be more practical.
10882,"cerseiElegant, I think."
10883,cerseiThank you for your help with the other matter.
10884,qyburnThe symptoms have abated?
10885,"cerseiGone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
10886,"qyburnNot a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
10887,jaimeOdd little man.
10888,"cerseiI've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
10889,jaimeWhat symptoms?
10890,cerseiSymptoms that are not your concern.
10891,jaimeYou let him touch you?
10892,cerseiYou jealous?
10893,jaimeI'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
10894,cerseiYou think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
10895,jaimeI'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
10896,"cerseiWell, they smell like Pycelle."
10897,jaimeYou drink more than you used to.
10898,cerseiYes.
10899,jaimeWhy?
10900,"cerseiLet's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
10901,jaimeIt must have been traumatic for you.
10902,cerseiMy only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
10903,jaimeA rather short siege.
10904,"cerseiA rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
10905,jaimeFather disowned me today.
10906,cerseiHe can't disown you. You're all he's got.
10907,jaimeYou're forgetting Tyrion.
10908,"cerseiYou don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
10909,jaimeStaying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
10910,cerseiNot now.
10911,jaimeI want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
10912,jaimeSomething's changed.
10913,cerseiEverything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
10914,jaimeWhat do you want me to apologize for?
10915,cerseiFor leaving me.
10916,jaimeYou think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
10917,cerseiDon't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
10918,"jaimeEvery day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
10919,cerseiYou took too long.
10920,jaimeI... What are you saying?
10921,cerseiI'm saying you took too long.
10922,cerseiCome in.
10923,jaimeGo away.
10924,"mareiForgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
10925,tormundYou plan on killing all the crows yourself?
10926,ygritteDo you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
10927,tormundWe wait for Mance's orders.
10928,"ygritteYou sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
10929,"tormundAnd what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
10930,"ygritteYeah, well, he's a liar."
10931,"tormundHe is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
10932,ygritteI did.
10933,"tormundI've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
10934,tormundThenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
10935,tormundMance sent you?
10936,tormundHow did you find us?
10937,"tormundYou came from the south, not the north."
10938,wargTook a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
10939,styrWhy does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
10940,tormundHelp yourself.
10941,styrMaybe everything's just better fed down here.
10942,"styrFat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
10943,"styrYou didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
10944,tormundI'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
10945,styrShe yours?
10946,ygritteI'm not anybody's.
10947,styrToo scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
10948,"styrThink of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
10949,"styrI know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
10950,officerDraw. Loose.
10951,"jonLast time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
10952,samSometimes I want to hate you.
10953,"samWell, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
10954,samThey're... they're ready for you.
10955,jonHe's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
10956,samNo one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
10957,jonI've done plenty wrong.
10958,alliserSo you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
10959,jonI didn't murder him.
10960,alliserNo? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
10961,jonHe wanted me to kill him.
10962,janosA bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
10963,jonThe Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
10964,alliserDon't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
10965,"jonThen you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
10966,janosThe free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
10967,"jonAye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
10968,"janosYou admit to breaking your vows, then?"
10969,jonI do.
10970,janosThe law is the law. The boy must die.
10971,"maesterIf we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
10972,alliserThere's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
10973,"jonWhile we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
10974,alliserImpossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
10975,"jon100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
10976,janosGiants?
10977,"jonHave you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
10978,"janosI commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
10979,jonAnd now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
10980,janosHow dare you?!
10981,jonThere's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
10982,jonDo you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
10983,"maesterNone of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
10984,"alliserI am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
10985,"maesterYes, you are."
10986,alliserAnd I don't trust the bastard.
10987,maesterHe told the truth.
10988,alliserAnd you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
10989,maesterI grew up in King's Landing.
10990,"olennaNo. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
10991,olennaYour grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
10992,"margaeryThe wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
10993,olennaNonsense.
10994,"olennaMy little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
10995,"olennaThe Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
10996,margaeryPerhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
10997,"olennaYou watch that. Even here, even with me."
10998,olennaMy word.
10999,brienneMy lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
11000,olennaWe know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
11001,olennaI hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
11002,"brienneMy lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
11003,olennaYou dare not refuse.
11004,margaeryA shadow?
11005,"brienneA shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
11006,margaeryJoffrey is our king now.
11007,brienneI meant no offense.
11008,margaeryAnd you've given none.
11009,"jaimeAll the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
11010,"joffreyYes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
11011,jaimeSer Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
11012,"merynI've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
11013,"jaimeAnd I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
11014,merynThe people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
11015,"jaimeMargaery Tyrell, I've heard."
11016,joffreyBy my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11017,jaimeThe war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11018,"joffreyI broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
11019,"jaimeMy apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
11020,joffreyBusy getting captured.
11021,"jaimeSo this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
11022,jaimeSo they say.
11023,joffreySer Jaime Lannister.
11024,joffreySomeone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
11025,jaimeThere's still time.
11026,joffreyIs there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
11027,"jaimeI use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
11028,daenerysHave you ever been to Meereen?
11029,"missandeiSeveral times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
11030,daenerysAnd?
11031,"missandeiThey say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
11032,daenerysAnd now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
11033,"missandeiIf they're smart, Your Grace."
11034,daenerysYou were told to ride at the back of the train.
11035,"daarioYes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
11036,missandeiYour Grace.
11037,"daenerysAll right, what is this matter of strategy?"
11038,daarioA dusk rose.
11039,daenerysWould you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
11040,daarioAnd this one's called lady's lace.
11041,daenerysWould you like to walk without shoes?
11042,"daarioYou have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
11043,daarioHarpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
11044,"daenerysYou are a gambler, aren't you?"
11045,daarioYour Grace.
11046,jorahThere's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
11047,daenerysHow many miles are there between here and Meereen?
11048,"barristan163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
11049,daenerysYou will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
11050,brienneThere she is.
11051,"jaimeYes, there she is."
11052,brienneAnd? You made a promise.
11053,jaimeTo return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
11054,brienneTo keep them safe.
11055,"jaimeWell, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
11056,brienneA complication does not release you from a vow.
11057,jaimeWhat do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
11058,brienneLook me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
11059,"jaimeAre you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
11060,serIt's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
11061,sansaYou're drunk.
11062,serYes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
11063,sansaSer Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
11064,"serI can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
11065,sansaAnyone would have done the same.
11066,"serBut only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
11067,"serIt belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
11068,"sansaI can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
11069,serI don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
11070,"sansaI'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
11071,serYeah.
11072,aryaWhen am I going to get a horse of my own?
11073,sandorThe little lady wants a pony.
11074,aryaThe little lady wants away from your stench.
11075,"sandorHorses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"
11076,aryaWhy don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
11077,sandorNo.
11078,"aryaYou're not very smart, are you?"
11079,sandorI'm not a thief.
11080,"aryaYou're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
11081,sandorA man's got to have a code.
11082,aryaYou think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
11083,"sandorYou've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
11084,aryaI'm hungry. You're hungry.
11085,"sandorFive horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach."
11086,aryaI know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
11087,aryaHe killed Lommy.
11088,sandorWhat the fuck's a Lommy?
11089,aryaHe was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
11090,sandorGot what?
11091,aryaMy sword Needle.
11092,sandorNeedle? Of course you named your sword.
11093,aryaLots of people name their swords.
11094,sandorLots of cunts.
11095,sandorWhat are you... get back here.
11096,aryaMy brother gave me that sword.
11097,sandorGet back here.
11098,aryaHe killed my friend.
11099,sandorI don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
11100,"manCome on, give it up."
11101,manCome here.
11102,manLet's have a feel there.
11103,manLeave it.
11104,"innkeeperPlease, she's a good girl."
11105,polliverShut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
11106,polliverI know you.
11107,polliverYou're the Hound.
11108,polliverPour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
11109,sandorI could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
11110,polliverJust keeping the king's peace.
11111,sandorNo need. The war's over.
11112,polliverSo I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
11113,sandorNone taken.
11114,"polliverHe's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?"
11115,"polliverBut I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
11116,sandorShe's all right. I've had better.
11117,"polliverYou know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
11118,sandorI'm not going to King's Landing.
11119,polliverThink about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
11120,sandorFuck the king.
11121,"polliverWhen I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
11122,sandorHere I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
11123,polliverYou got money to pay for it?
11124,sandorYou paid for it?
11125,"polliverNo. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
11126,sandorNot a penny.
11127,sandorI'll still take that chicken.
11128,polliverTell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
11129,sandorYou're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
11130,sandorAh. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
11131,polliverYou don't seem to understand the situation.
11132,"sandorI understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
11133,polliverYou lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
11134,sandorSomeone is.
11135,"aryaSomething wrong with your leg, boy?"
11136,polliverWhat? What do you mean?
11137,aryaCan you walk? I've got to carry you?
11138,polliverCarry me?
11139,aryaFine little blade.
11140,aryaMaybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
11141,ramsayTansy! Tansy! Tansy!
11142,ramsayTansy! Tansy!
11143,ramsayThere you are.
11144,"myrandaI can't see her, Ramsay."
11145,ramsayTansy!
11146,"ramsayIf you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
11147,ramsayTansy.
11148,myrandaWhere is she?
11149,"ramsayTansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
11150,"ramsayGood girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
11151,myrandaI only wounded her.
11152,"ramsayYou brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
11153,"theonA fine shot, master. My lady."
11154,"tansyPlease, my lord. It hurts."
11155,"ramsayOh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
11156,myrandaShe thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
11157,"ramsayWe have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
11158,tansyWhy? I did whatever you asked.
11159,ramsayBut you made Myranda feel jealous.
11160,myrandaMe jealous of her?
11161,"tansyMy lord, please."
11162,ramsayYou can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
11163,ramsayRip her! Rip her! Rip her!
11164,ramsayNot so pretty now.
11165,"tyrionYour new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
11166,podrickIs it solid gold?
11167,jaimeGilded steel.
11168,tyrionYou're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
11169,jaimeI'm not hungry.
11170,"tyrionYou lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
11171,"tyrionA toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
11172,jaimeOh!
11173,podrickI'll clean it up.
11174,"jaimeNo, I'll do it. Leave us."
11175,tyrionIt's only wine.
11176,jaimeI can't fight anymore.
11177,tyrionWhat about your left?
11178,"jaimeI can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
11179,tyrionYou're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
11180,jaimeI'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
11181,"tyrionTrain, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
11182,"jaimeWith whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
11183,"tyrionYou need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
11184,jaimeMy brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
11185,bronnHe tells me you shit gold just like your father.
11186,jaimeIs this place safe?
11187,"bronnThere's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
11188,jaimeUh-huh.
11189,"bronnRight here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
11190,"bronnI've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
11191,"bronnAnd if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
11192,jaimeI haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
11193,"jaimeAh! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
11194,bronnBest time to attack a man.
11195,bronnMind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
11196,bronnPlan on growing it back?
11197,"jaimeCome on, then."
11198,manOpen the gates!
11199,manRiders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
11200,ramsayFather. Welcome home.
11201,"rooseWalda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
11202,"ramsayA pleasure, Mother."
11203,waldaHello.
11204,"rooseSee that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
11205,"womanThis way, my lady."
11206,rooseWhere is your prize?
11207,ramsayWith the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
11208,ramsayI hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
11209,lockeWord travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
11210,ramsayFather.
11211,rooseWhat did you do to him?
11212,"ramsayI trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11213,rooseYou flayed him.
11214,ramsayPeeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11215,rooseThis was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11216,ramsayWe've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11217,"rooseMy banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11218,ramsayI already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11219,rooseYou sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11220,ramsayYou made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11221,rooseI had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11222,"ramsayTheon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11223,rooseI placed far too much trust in you.
11224,"ramsayReek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11225,"theonI'm sorry, my lord."
11226,ramsayGive him the razor.
11227,"ramsayIf I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11228,"ramsayGo on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11229,"ramsayReek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11230,"theonI don't know, my lord."
11231,rooseYou murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11232,"ramsayReek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11233,"theonNo, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11234,ramsayAnd crisped them so no one would know.
11235,"theonYes, my lord."
11236,"ramsayThe Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11237,"ramsayOh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
11238,rooseYou ready for a hunt?
11239,merynAlways. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11240,lockeYour pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11241,theonJon Snow is at Castle Black.
11242,lockeWho the fuck is Jon Snow?
11243,rooseTheir bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11244,"ramsayEven if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11245,"rooseYou want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
11246,tyrionLord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
11247,varysI'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
11248,"tyrionOh, to be foreign."
11249,varysAhem.
11250,varysShae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
11251,tyrionSo I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
11252,"varysNo, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11253,tyrionForgive me if I don't weep for you.
11254,varysNo one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
11255,"tyrionShe won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
11256,varysYour father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
11257,"maceFrom House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
11258,maceMay you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
11259,"joffreyA handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
11260,"maceI shall be honored, Your Grace."
11261,cerseiShe's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
11262,tywinHave her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
11263,joffreyA book?
11264,"tyrionThe Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
11265,"joffreyNow that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
11266,"tywinOne of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
11267,"pycelleCareful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
11268,joffreySo they say.
11269,joffreySuch a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
11270,manStormbringer.
11271,manTerminus.
11272,manWidow's Wail.
11273,manWolfsbane.
11274,"joffreyWidow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again."
11275,tyrionDon't.
11276,"shaeYou want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
11277,tyrionDon't call me that.
11278,shaeWhat should I call you?
11279,tyrionI'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
11280,shaeOur friendship?
11281,tyrionThere's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
11282,shaeWhat?
11283,"tyrionYou'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
11284,shaeWhat is this?
11285,"tyrionI'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
11286,shaeShe doesn't want you.
11287,tyrionI need to do right by her.
11288,shaeYou don't want her.
11289,tyrionBy our children.
11290,shaeWhat are you afraid of?
11291,tyrionI'm not afraid.
11292,shaeYou are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
11293,tyrionI need you to leave.
11294,shaeI'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
11295,tyrionShae.
11296,"shaeWe will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
11297,tyrionYou're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
11298,shaeHow many whores have you been with?
11299,tyrionI have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
11300,tyrionYou'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
11301,"melisandreHear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
11302,"axellSire, I served you well."
11303,"melisandreLord of Light, show us the way..."
11304,"axellSelyse, you're my sister!"
11305,selyseYours are the stars that guide us.
11306,axellTell him! Tell him!
11307,"melisandreLord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
11308,selyseDid you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
11309,davosLord Florent was your brother by law.
11310,stannisHe was an infidel.
11311,"davosHe worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
11312,stannisI ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
11313,davosHow many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
11314,stannisA good deal more than you.
11315,"selyseDid you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
11316,"davosI'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
11317,stannisMeat's off.
11318,selyseOur larders are almost empty.
11319,"stannisServe fish, then. We're on an island."
11320,selyseYou hate fish.
11321,"stannisI hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
11322,"selyseWhen Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
11323,stannisOf course I remember.
11324,"selyseHave you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
11325,melisandreIt's all I knew when I was a child.
11326,selyseUntil you found the Lord of Light?
11327,melisandreUntil he found me.
11328,selyseI fear for our daughter's soul.
11329,melisandreEvery mother should fear for her childo s soul.
11330,selyseShe's a stubborn little beast.
11331,stannisShe's a child.
11332,selyseYou barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
11333,stannisShe's my daughter. You will not strike her.
11334,selyseAs you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
11335,shireenCome in.
11336,"melisandreWere you sleeping, Princess?"
11337,melisandreDid you watch the ceremony on the beach?
11338,shireenI heard it.
11339,melisandreAnd it frightened you?
11340,shireenSer Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
11341,"melisandreThey're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
11342,shireenBut they screamed.
11343,melisandreWomen scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
11344,shireenAfterward they aren't ash and bone.
11345,"melisandreYou have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
11346,shireenAnd you didn't have this.
11347,"melisandreNo. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
11348,"shireenI read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
11349,"melisandreLies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
11350,shireenThere are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
11351,"melisandreThere's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
11352,hodorHodor.
11353,branWhy did you wake me?
11354,meeraYou've been gone for hours.
11355,branI was hungry.
11356,meeraWe're all hungry.
11357,branI was just eating.
11358,"jojenSummer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
11359,"jojenMust be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
11360,"meeraYou'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
11361,"branHodor, take me to the tree."
11362,threeeyedLook for me... beneath the tree.
11363,cerseiHe saw us.
11364,threeeyedNorth.
11365,branI know where we have to go.
11366,"septonLet it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."
11367,"joffreyWith this kiss, I pledge my love."
11368,sansaWe have a new queen.
11369,tyrionBetter her than you.
11370,"tywinBit much, wouldn't you say?"
11371,olennaIt feels proportionate.
11372,tywinProportionate to what?
11373,olennaThe expected extravagance.
11374,tywinPeople who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
11375,olennaYou ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
11376,"olennaNot now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
11377,"olennaAnyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
11378,tywinShall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
11379,"olennaNo, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
11380,tywinI'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
11381,"olennaWe both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
11382,bronnAll taken care of.
11383,tyrionYou saw her board the ship?
11384,"bronnAye, she's on it."
11385,tyrionYou saw the ship sail away?
11386,"bronnNo one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
11387,tyrionHow do you know?
11388,"bronnBecause if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
11389,tyrionThere's someone following you?
11390,"bronnShe's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
11391,oberynHello.
11392,tyrionHello.
11393,oberynNot you.
11394,"olennaYou look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
11395,tyrionMy lady. My lady.
11396,"olennaLord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
11397,"musicianA coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord..."
11398,joffreyVery good. Very good. Off you go.
11399,"margaeryMy love, why don't we make the announcement?"
11400,joffreyEveryone. The queen would like to say a few words.
11401,"margaeryWe are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
11402,cerseiYou're an example to us all.
11403,"lorasSer Jaime, I'm very sorry."
11404,"jaimeSer Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
11405,lorasAs does yours.
11406,"jaimeSo, looking forward to your wedding?"
11407,"lorasYes, very much."
11408,jaimeOur fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
11409,lorasThey certainly are.
11410,"jaimePerhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
11411,lorasAnd neither will you.
11412,brienneYour Grace. My king. My queen.
11413,margaeryLady Brienne. So good of you to come.
11414,"brienneI'm no lady, Your Grace."
11415,cerseiDid you just bow?
11416,"brienneApologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
11417,joffreyYou're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
11418,"margaeryThat's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
11419,joffreyA shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
11420,brienneI just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
11421,"joffreyYes, yes."
11422,margaeryThank you. I hope we see more of you.
11423,cerseiLady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
11424,"brienneAs you say, Your Grace."
11425,cerseiI owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
11426,"brienneIn truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
11427,cerseiDid he? Haven't heard that story before.
11428,"brienneNot such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
11429,cerseiI'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
11430,"brienneI don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
11431,cerseiBut you love him.
11432,brienneYour Grace.
11433,"pycelleNo, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
11434,cerseiShe'll do no such thing.
11435,"pycelleOh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
11436,cerseiYou should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
11437,maidYour Grace.
11438,pycelleQyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
11439,cerseiMore repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
11440,"pycelleYour Grace, I am a man of learning."
11441,cerseiMy little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
11442,pycelleI never meant to annoy anyone.
11443,cerseiBut you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
11444,"pycelleYour Grace, Queen Margaery-"
11445,cerseiThe queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
11446,joffreyA gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
11447,tywinYou're in rather a good mood.
11448,cerseiI suppose I am.
11449,tywinI won't ask why.
11450,cerseiSmall pleasures.
11451,oberynYour Grace. Lord Tywin.
11452,tywinPrince Oberyn.
11453,"oberynI don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
11454,ellariaMy lord. My lady.
11455,tywinCharmed.
11456,cerseiCan't say I've ever met a Sand before.
11457,"ellariaWe are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
11458,"oberynBastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
11459,cerseiNo? How tolerant of you.
11460,"oberynI expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
11461,"cerseiI suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
11462,"tywinPlease give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
11463,oberynThey call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
11464,tywinNoblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
11465,"oberynPeople everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
11466,"joffreyEveryone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
11467,"joffreyI give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
11468,renlyI'm the rightful king.
11469,robbKing in the North!
11470,joffreyYes!
11471,balonTraitor. You're a traitor.
11472,joffreyFor the Seven Kingdoms!
11473,joffreyLet the war begin.
11474,"stannisRenly, you're no king."
11475,"balonAway, degenerate. Away. Away."
11476,"renlyOoh, careful."
11477,stannisGo on.
11478,renlyI want you to be my prince. Stannis!
11479,"balonWho's got the gold now, Stark?"
11480,robbI am the rightful king.
11481,"balonChallenge me, ruffian."
11482,robbTake that.
11483,balonI'm drowning. I'm drowning.
11484,robbI am the King in the North!
11485,stannisNot wildfire!
11486,tyrionPay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
11487,"podrickYes, my lord."
11488,tyrionWe'll have to find another way to thank the king.
11489,joffreyCharge!
11490,"joffreyReady, again."
11491,robbI am the King in the North! - Charge!
11492,joffreyCharge! Yes!
11493,joffreyYour head!
11494,joffreyFine gentlemen.
11495,"joffreyWell fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
11496,"tyrionOne taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
11497,tyrionA fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
11498,joffreyIt did not spill.
11499,"margaeryMy love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
11500,"joffreyWell, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
11501,tyrionYour Grace does me a great honor.
11502,joffreyIt's not meant as an honor.
11503,joffreyBring me my goblet.
11504,joffreyWhat good is an empty cup? Fill it.
11505,joffreyKneel. Kneel before your king.
11506,joffreyKneel. I said... kneel!
11507,"margaeryLook, the pie."
11508,joffreyMy queen.
11509,margaeryWonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
11510,sansaCan we leave now?
11511,tyrionLet's find out.
11512,"joffreyUncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
11513,"tyrionI thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
11514,"joffreyNo, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
11515,"joffreyWell, hurry up. This pie is dry."
11516,"joffreyMm, good. Needs washing down."
11517,"tyrionIf it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
11518,"joffreyNo. No, you'll wait here... un..."
11519,tyrionYour Grace?
11520,joffreyIt's nothing.
11521,margaeryHe's choking!
11522,olennaHelp the poor boy.
11523,"olennaIdiots, help your king."
11524,jaimeMove away!
11525,jaimeJoffrey! Joffrey!
11526,cerseiHelp him! Someone help him!
11527,cerseiJoffrey!
11528,serCome with me now.
11529,cerseiJoffrey! Joffrey!
11530,"serIf you want to live, we have to leave."
11531,cerseiDon't touch him!
11532,"cerseiJoffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
11533,cerseiMy son.
11534,manHe's gone. Our king is gone.
11535,"cerseiHe did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
11536,cerseiYou did this. You did this!
11537,serWe have to leave.
11538,cerseiTake him! Take him!
11539,cerseiWhere is his wife? Where's Sansa?
11540,tywinFind her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
11541,cerseiWhere is she?!
11542,tywinNo one leaves the capital! No one!
11543,serGet in.
11544,sansaWhere are we going?
11545,serSomewhere safe.
11546,"serUp you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
11547,sansaLord Baelish?
11548,"petyrPetyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
11549,petyrGood. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
11550,serLord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
11551,"petyrSoftly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
11552,"serI should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
11553,"ser10,000."
11554,serWait!
11555,"petyrShh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
11556,sansaI didn't murder anyone.
11557,"petyrI know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
11558,sansaWhy did you kill him?
11559,petyrBecause he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
11560,sansaHe saved me.
11561,"petyrSaved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
11562,sansaHe was helping me because I saved his life.
11563,"petyrYes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
11564,petyrI had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
11565,sansaWe're all liars here.
11566,"petyrCome, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
11567,margaerySo am I the queen?
11568,"olennaMore than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
11569,"margaeryClawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
11570,"olennaThe world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
11571,margaeryWhat was it like?
11572,olennaThey took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
11573,margaeryOne of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
11574,"olennaNonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
11575,margaeryBut I would have been the queen.
11576,olennaOur alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
11577,tywinYour brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
11578,tywinI'm not trying to trick you.
11579,tommenIt means I'll become king.
11580,"tywinYes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
11581,tommenA good king?
11582,"tywinMm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
11583,cerseiThis is hardly the place or the time.
11584,tommenHoliness?
11585,tywinHmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
11586,tommenJustice.
11587,tywinYeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
11588,tommenNo.
11589,tywinNo.
11590,tommenWhat about strength?
11591,"tywinYes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
11592,tommenWisdom.
11593,tywinYes!
11594,tommenWisdom is what makes a good king.
11595,tywinYes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
11596,"tywinNo. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
11597,tommenA king needs a queen.
11598,"tywinYes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
11599,tommenYes.
11600,"tywinYes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
11601,tommenI don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
11602,jaimeHow are you?
11603,tommenI'm all right.
11604,jaimeYou are. You will be. I'll see to that.
11605,jaimePlease give the queen a moment alone with her son.
11606,"septonYes, my lord. All of you."
11607,"cerseiIt was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
11608,jaimeI don't know what I saw.
11609,cerseiAvenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
11610,jaimeTyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
11611,"cerseiI don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
11612,jaimeYou're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
11613,"cerseiJaime, not here, please. Please."
11614,cerseiStop it. Stop it. Stop.
11615,jaimeNo.
11616,cerseiStop it. Stop.
11617,cerseiStop. Stop. It's not right.
11618,cerseiIt's not right. It's not right.
11619,jaimeI don't care.
11620,cerseiDon't.
11621,"cerseiDon't. Jaime, don't."
11622,aryaGonna rain soon. Where are we?
11623,"sandorNear Fairmarket, I think."
11624,aryaYou think? You don't have a map?
11625,"sandorNo, I don't have a map."
11626,aryaMaybe we should get one.
11627,sandorJust point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
11628,aryaHow far is it to the Eyrie?
11629,sandorFar.
11630,aryaAnd you're sure we're going the right way?
11631,"sandorBelieve me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
11632,aryaOn your way where?
11633,"sandorWhy do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
11634,aryaI'd like to see Braavos one day.
11635,sandorWhy Braavos?
11636,aryaI have friends there.
11637,sandorI doubt it.
11638,farmerSeven blessings to you.
11639,sandorWhat do you want?
11640,farmerWhat do I want? This is my land.
11641,"sandorIf I'm standing on it, it's my land."
11642,aryaWe were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
11643,aryaHe's never been the same.
11644,farmerWhich house did he fight for?
11645,aryaThe Tullys of Riverrun.
11646,"farmerThere's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
11647,farmerWe ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
11648,sandorYou got to do all seven of the fuckers?
11649,aryaFather!
11650,farmerWe ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
11651,sandorAnd we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
11652,aryaI'm so sorry.
11653,aryaReally good.
11654,farmerDid you fight at the Twins?
11655,sandorCall that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
11656,farmerThe Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
11657,sandorGuest right don't mean much anymore.
11658,"farmerIt means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
11659,sandorYou got any ale?
11660,farmerAfraid not.
11661,sandorHow can a man not keep ale in his home?
11662,"farmerYou look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
11663,sandorWhat'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
11664,sandorFair wages for fair work.
11665,aryaWhat did you do?!
11666,sandorGet your horse saddled.
11667,aryaYou told me you weren't a thief.
11668,sandorI wasn't.
11669,aryaHe took us in. He fed us and you...
11670,"sandorAye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
11671,aryaYou don't know that.
11672,sandorI do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
11673,aryaYou're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
11674,sandorThere's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
11675,rangerRaper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
11676,"alliserThere he is, Sam the Slayer."
11677,janosGoing to visit your wildling whore?
11678,samShe's not a whore.
11679,janosNo? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
11680,samThey all think I'm lying.
11681,gillyAbout what?
11682,samKilling the white Walker.
11683,gillyYou're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
11684,samBut you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
11685,gillyA what?
11686,"samWell, a wildling."
11687,gillyMy father hated that word.
11688,"samIt's not a very nice word, I suppose."
11689,"gillyI don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
11690,samSo... are you all right? No one bothering you?
11691,gillyI get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
11692,samI worry about it sometimes. All the time.
11693,gillyWhy do you worry about it?
11694,"sam100 men, one woman."
11695,gillyThey've got other things to think about.
11696,samThat's the only thing they think about.
11697,gillyYou're being silly.
11698,samI'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
11699,gillyWhat about you?
11700,samWhat about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
11701,gillyThank you.
11702,samFor what?
11703,gillyFor worrying about me.
11704,"samI don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
11705,gillySo what are you saying?
11706,samMaybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
11707,gillyAre you bored of me?
11708,samBored of you? I... I want to protect you.
11709,gillyI'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
11710,davosYour Grace.
11711,stannisYou're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
11712,davosJoffrey?
11713,stannisThe usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
11714,"davosI will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
11715,stannisWhat progress have you made?
11716,davosI've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
11717,stannisHouse Peasebury.
11718,davosHouse Musgood.
11719,stannisHouse Musgood.
11720,davosAnd House Haigh.
11721,stannisHouse Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
11722,"davosWesteros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
11723,stannisThe Golden Company?
11724,davosThey've never broken a contract.
11725,stannisThey're sellswords.
11726,"davosWe're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
11727,stannisWe don't have any gold.
11728,davosNot yet.
11729,"stannisIf I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
11730,shireenYou're late.
11731,"davosI'm sorry, Princess."
11732,shireenI thought you weren't coming.
11733,davosThe Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
11734,"shireenYou won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
11735,"davosThat happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
11736,shireenIt's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
11737,shireenYou'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
11738,davosThe Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.
11739,davosThank you very much.
11740,shireenI like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
11741,"davosNo, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
11742,shireenWhat's the difference?
11743,"davosWell, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
11744,shireenMy father says a criminal is a criminal.
11745,davosYour father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
11746,shireenYou've sailed to Braavos?
11747,"davosOf course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
11748,shireenWhat was that for?
11749,davosI need you to write a message.
11750,shireenYou should write it yourself. It's good practice.
11751,davosIt's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
11752,davosTo the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
11753,shireenBut that's not you.
11754,davosI need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
11755,"samHe's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
11756,molesPrecious little thing.
11757,molesWhat's his name?
11758,gillySam.
11759,molesLovely. That the daddy?
11760,gillyNo.
11761,molesWhere's the daddy?
11762,gillyHe's dead.
11763,molesOh. Where you from?
11764,gillyNorth of here.
11765,molesNorth of here? You a fucking wildling?
11766,molesOnly room and board?
11767,samThat's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
11768,"molesCould find other work for her, too."
11769,samNo other work.
11770,molesThere'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
11771,samI promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
11772,gillyYou protected me north of the Wall.
11773,"samThis is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
11774,samYou have to trust me. It's for the best.
11775,gillyBest for you.
11776,"samOh, Gilly. Please don't."
11777,oberynGreedy.
11778,ellariaNo?
11779,"olyvarI'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
11780,oberynYou're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
11781,"ellariaThat's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
11782,oberynYour loss.
11783,olyvarYou like them both the same? Boys and girls?
11784,oberynDoes that surprise you?
11785,olyvarEveryone has a preference.
11786,"oberynThen everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
11787,olyvarI hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
11788,"oberynWhat are you, 25?"
11789,ellariaChildren.
11790,"oberynSomeday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
11791,olyvarDid you?
11792,ellariaHe is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
11793,oberynThey will all have to line up behind you.
11794,tywinPrince Oberyn.
11795,oberynLord Tywin.
11796,tywinMay we have the room?
11797,"ellariaCall my name if you need me, lover."
11798,oberynWould you like to sit?
11799,"tywinNo, thank you."
11800,oberynSome wine?
11801,oberynI'm sorry about your grandson.
11802,tywinAre you?
11803,oberynI don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
11804,tywinWhich way is that?
11805,"oberynAre you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
11806,tywinSome believe the king choked.
11807,oberynSome believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
11808,tywinI hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
11809,oberynI did. This is why I know.
11810,"tywinYour hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
11811,oberynRather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
11812,tywinYou spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
11813,oberynYou think we conspired together?
11814,tywinWhat did you discuss?
11815,oberynThe death of my sister.
11816,tywinFor which you blame me.
11817,oberynShe was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
11818,"tywinHere I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
11819,"oberynYou are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
11820,tywinMen at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
11821,oberynSo you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
11822,tywinCategorically.
11823,oberynI would like to speak with the Mountain.
11824,tywinI'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
11825,oberynHe might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
11826,tywinI could arrange for this meeting.
11827,oberynBut you want something in return.
11828,"tywinThere will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
11829,oberynWhy?
11830,"tywinNot long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
11831,"oberynWell, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
11832,tywinI will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
11833,"oberynI never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
11834,"tywinWe are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
11835,oberynYou're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
11836,tywinWe need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
11837,tyrionPodrick. Apologies for the stench.
11838,"podrickI brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
11839,tyrionA noble effort.
11840,"podrickThey didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
11841,tyrionYou're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
11842,"podrickI've heard nothing, my lord."
11843,tyrionI suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
11844,podrickYou're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
11845,tyrionDo you believe I murdered Joffrey?
11846,"podrickNo, my lord. You didn't?"
11847,"tyrionNo. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
11848,podrickYour father.
11849,tyrionOf course.
11850,podrickMace Tyrell.
11851,tyrionWho will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
11852,podrickAnd Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
11853,tyrionOberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
11854,"podrickI'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
11855,"tyrionOh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
11856,"podrickMy lord, she's gone."
11857,tyrionGone?
11858,podrickNo one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
11859,"tyrionNo one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
11860,"podrickYes, my lord?"
11861,tyrionThey'll be following you now.
11862,podrickWho will?
11863,"tyrionI don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
11864,"podrickAny other witnesses, my lord?"
11865,tyrionVarys could vouch for me if he dared.
11866,podrickHe's already been called as a witness for the queen.
11867,tyrionOf course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
11868,"podrickI've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
11869,tyrionWhy not?
11870,podrickThey say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
11871,tyrionAnd my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
11872,"podrickI'll ask, my lord."
11873,"podrickThere's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
11874,tyrionSer Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
11875,"podrickI didn't tell them anything, my lord."
11876,tyrionAre you going to accept their offer?
11877,podrickMy lord.
11878,"tyrionTestifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
11879,"podrickYou've been good to me, my lord."
11880,"tyrionPod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
11881,"podrickI already gave them an answer, my lord."
11882,"tyrionI will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
11883,"tyrionPod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
11884,"podrickFarewell, my lord."
11885,tyrionPod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
11886,ollyMother says it's time to eat.
11887,guymonWhat's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
11888,ollyPotatoes.
11889,"guymonPotatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
11890,manThe wildlings!
11891,ollysGuymon! Hide. Hide!
11892,styrYou know how to get to Castle Black?
11893,ollyYes. Yes.
11894,styrThose your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
11895,yarwyckWe need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
11896,menAye! Aye!
11897,yarwyckThree dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
11898,menAye!
11899,"alliserIf we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
11900,maesterWe have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
11901,pypThere's got to be a way to protect them.
11902,"alliserYou're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"
11903,"jonMance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
11904,alliserWe need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
11905,pypRangers returning.
11906,jonHelp him.
11907,dolorousThought you'd have blue eyes by now.
11908,alliserWhat took you so long?
11909,grennWe were held up.
11910,alliserBy what?
11911,grennChains.
11912,dolorousWe were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
11913,jonAnd the mutineers stayed?
11914,dolorousThey're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
11915,jonWe need to ride north and kill them all.
11916,"alliserWe just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
11917,"jonIt's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
11918,pypI don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
11919,daenerysAre they attacking?
11920,jorahA single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
11921,daenerysWhat is he doing?
11922,barristanI believe he means to...
11923,"missandeiHe says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
11924,"barristanIgnore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
11925,jorahThey're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
11926,"daenerysI have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
11927,"greyAllow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
11928,daenerysYou are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
11929,"barristanYour Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
11930,daenerysWhich is why you must remain by my side.
11931,"jorahI've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
11932,"daenerysYou are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
11933,"daarioI was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
11934,daenerysVery well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
11935,"missandeiHe is very brave, Your Grace."
11936,"daenerysYes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
11937,daenerysYou sure you don't want a horse?
11938,daarioWhy would I want a horse?
11939,daenerysHorses are faster than men.
11940,daarioHorses are dumber than men.
11941,daenerysI am Daenerys Stormborn.
11942,"daenerysYour Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
11943,daenerysYour enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
11944,daenerysFire!
11945,"greyMy name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
11946,missandeiIsles. Summer Isles.
11947,greySummer Isles.
11948,missandeiI am from an island called Naath.
11949,greyWhen they took you?
11950,"missandeiWhen did they take me?"" I was five years old."
11951,greyYou remember your home?
11952,missandeiI remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
11953,"greyUnsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
11954,missandeiThat's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
11955,greyI don't want return.
11956,missandeiKill the masters.
11957,greyKill the masters.
11958,daenerysHow are the lessons coming?
11959,"missandeiVery well, Your Grace."
11960,"greyMissandei is teacher good, my queen."
11961,daenerysYou'll have to continue later. It's time.
11962,mossadorYou heard her! She said she came to free us.
11963,elderYou are a fool. The masters are too strong.
11964,mossadorShe will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
11965,mossadorShe has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
11966,meereenI want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
11967,"elderI've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
11968,greyAll men must die.
11969,"greyBut I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
11970,elderWho are you?
11971,"greyThis one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
11972,elderYou are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
11973,"meereenWe have no training, weapons."
11974,"greyThere are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
11975,slavesMhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
11976,slavesMhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
11977,slavesMhysa! Mhysa!
11978,"daenerysRemind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
11979,"jorah163, Khaleesi."
11980,"daenerysYes, that was it."
11981,"barristanYour Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
11982,daenerysI will answer injustice with justice.
11983,jaimeWhat the hell was that?
11984,bronnThat was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
11985,"jaimeYou're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
11986,bronnYou learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
11987,jaimeYou talk to my brother this way?
11988,bronnAll the time. He got used to it.
11989,jaimeDo you think he did it?
11990,"bronnNo. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
11991,"bronnYou haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
11992,jaimeWe're done for today.
11993,bronnYour brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
11994,jaimeYou stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
11995,bronnAye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
11996,"jaimeTo tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
11997,tyrionIs that supposed to make me feel better?
11998,jaimeMaybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
11999,"tyrionIt's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12000,jaimeHow do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12001,tyrionHer son?
12002,jaimeDon't. You know what's coming?
12003,"tyrionMy trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12004,"jaimeNow that you mention it, she did ask."
12005,"tyrionSo, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12006,jaimeDepends. Did you do it?
12007,tyrionThe Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12008,jaimeAre you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12009,"tyrionWell, you could set me free."
12010,jaimeYou know I can't.
12011,tyrionThen there's really nothing else to say.
12012,jaimeWhat do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12013,"tyrionSorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12014,jaimeInappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12015,tyrionExcept I didn't do it.
12016,"jaimeWhich is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
12017,jaimeNot just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12018,tyrionSansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12019,"tyrionNo, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12020,sansaWhere are you taking me?
12021,petyrI'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12022,sansaDid you kill Joffrey?
12023,petyrDid I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12024,sansaI know it was you.
12025,petyrAnd who helped me with this conspiracy?
12026,"sansaWell, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12027,petyrWhy not?
12028,sansaBecause you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12029,petyrThen perhaps it was your husband.
12030,sansaNo.
12031,petyrHow do you know?
12032,sansaI just do.
12033,petyrYou're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12034,"sansaThe poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12035,"petyrA man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12036,"sansaI don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12037,petyrSo many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12038,sansaAnd what do you want?
12039,"petyrEverything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12040,sansaWho could trust you?
12041,"petyrI don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12042,margaeryI can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12043,"olennaThe time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12044,olennaHave you been to see Tommen yet?
12045,margaeryNo. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12046,"olennaI wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12047,olennaHow absentminded of me.
12048,margaeryMm-hmm.
12049,"olennaThe following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12050,"olennaAnd once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12051,"margaeryWell, he could have done."
12052,"olennaHe could have done,but he didn't."
12053,"margaeryYou don't know, Grandmother."
12054,"olennaBut I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12055,margaeryWhat? I don't understand.
12056,olennaShh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12057,jonBring it through! And again.
12058,jonVery nice. Good.
12059,jonA lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12060,jonLet's see what you can do.
12061,"jonOlly, you just watch for now."
12062,ollyI can fight.
12063,jonHave you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12064,ollyI was!
12065,"grennI believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12066,"jonYou two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
12067,jonYou know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12068,lockeHe wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12069,alliserLord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12070,jonGrenn and I were helping them.
12071,"alliserGrenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12072,jonSomeone has to train them.
12073,alliserAnd that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
12074,alliserGet back to work. Now! I said now!
12075,janosThe bastardo s well-liked.You're not.
12076,alliserYou think I care if they like me? We're at war.
12077,janosFor now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12078,"lockeA bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12079,jonMy father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12080,lockeName's Locke.
12081,jonJon Snow.
12082,jonYou fight well.
12083,lockeWhat brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12084,"alliserCome on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12085,lockeGuess I was wrong.
12086,"jaimeYou sent for me, Your Grace?"
12087,cerseiYour Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12088,jaimeSer Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12089,cerseiSo one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12090,jaimeI promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12091,cerseiThe way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12092,jaimeWhat?
12093,cerseiI've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12094,jaimeYou know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12095,cerseiShe hoped or did you promise?
12096,"jaimeI swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12097,cerseiSo you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12098,jaimeI wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12099,"cerseiYou didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12100,"jaimeCatelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12101,cerseiI know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12102,jaimeI had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12103,cerseiAnd?
12104,"jaimeHe didn't do it, Cersei."
12105,"cerseiYou've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12106,tommenSer Pounce?
12107,tommenHow did you get past the Kingsguard?
12108,margaeryKingsguard.
12109,tommenI don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12110,"margaeryI'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12111,"margaeryDid you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12112,tommenYes. But if my mother found out...
12113,"margaeryIt can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12114,tommenYes? Tell me a secret.
12115,margaeryHello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12116,tommenThat's Ser Pounce.
12117,margaeryVery handsome.
12118,tommenJoffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12119,margaeryThat's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12120,tommenNo. I don't think I am.
12121,margaeryThat's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12122,"tommenWe say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
12123,"margaeryWhen we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
12124,"margaeryRemember, our little secret."
12125,"brienneSer Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
12126,jaimeIt's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
12127,brienneValyrian steel.
12128,jaimeMmm. It's yours.
12129,brienneI can't accept this.
12130,"jaimeIt was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12131,jaimeI hope I got your measurements right.
12132,brienneI'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
12133,jaimeI almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12134,brienneI don't need a squire.
12135,jaimeOf course you do.
12136,brienneHe'll slow me down.
12137,jaimeMy brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
12138,"podrickI won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
12139,jaimeSee? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
12140,bronnCompliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
12141,"bronnWhat are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
12142,jaimeThey say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
12143,brienneOathkeeper.
12144,"jaimeGood-bye, Brienne."
12145,"podrickCome on, move."
12146,samI should neverhave taken her away.
12147,jonShe wasn't safe here.
12148,"samShe's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
12149,jonCastle Black could be next.
12150,samI should go back for Gilly.
12151,jonWe have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
12152,samI remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
12153,"jonAnd I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
12154,"samI wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
12155,jonHow fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
12156,samI don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
12157,jonThe wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
12158,samCraster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
12159,lockeSnow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
12160,"alliserYour foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only."
12161,"jonThank you, Ser Alliser."
12162,"jonAhem, brothers."
12163,"jonI'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
12164,jonI can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
12165,"lockeThen let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
12166,"jonThank you, brothers."
12167,"womanNo, don't. Don't, please."
12168,womanPlease don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
12169,tannerKarl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
12170,"tannerAny command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?"
12171,"tannerDid you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
12172,tannerRast.
12173,tannerGo outside and feed the beast.
12174,rastWe should kill that thing.
12175,"tannerYou should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me."
12176,"tannerHaven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
12177,"tannerMaybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
12178,"tannerI was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
12179,womenA gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
12180,tannerWhat the fuck is that?
12181,sissyCraster's last child. A boy.
12182,tannerWhat am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
12183,tannerDon't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
12184,sissyHe didn't kill them. He offered them.
12185,tannerTo who?
12186,sissyTo the gods. The white walkers.

12188,tannerShut up!
12189,tannerSo... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
12190,tannerRast is headed that way.
12191,rastPink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
12192,rastFuck!
12193,hodorHodor.
12194,branDo you hear that?
12195,meeraIs that a baby?
12196,jojenIt's coming.
12197,branI'm going out there.
12198,"meeraNo, we need to stay together."
12199,branI'm going.
12200,jojenBran. Bran.
12201,hodorHodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12202,"meeraBran, what happened?"
12203,"branSummer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
12204,meeraWho?
12205,"branI didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
12206,branThey're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
12207,"meeraIf Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
12208,"meeraThey might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
12209,branNo.
12210,"meeraBran, we need to go now."
12211,branI'm not leaving without Summer.
12212,meeraCan you remember where the cage was?
12213,branThe east side of the keep.
12214,"meeraIf I'm not backsoon, we'll meet..."
12215,"rastIf I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world."
12216,tannerHelp him up.
12217,tannerThis is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
12218,"tannerYou see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
12219,tannerI like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
12220,"tannerSee you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
12221,rastWhat the fuck's wrong with him?
12222,tannerCome here.
12223,"meeraNo, please. Please.Please, let me help him."
12224,tannerWho are you?
12225,meeraPlease.
12226,branI'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
12227,rastIt's Jon Snow's brother.
12228,meeraIt's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
12229,tannerAnd I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
12230,meeraI'm right here.
12231,"septonMay the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!"
12232,allLong may he reign!
12233,septonSpecial day.
12234,pycelleYour Grace.
12235,varysYour Grace.
12236,manYour Grace.
12237,margaeryYour Grace.
12238,cerseiThere he is.
12239,margaeryLong may he reign.
12240,cerseiLong may he reign.
12241,margaeryHe sits the throne like he was born to it.
12242,"cerseiYes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
12243,"margaeryNo, he wasn't."
12244,cerseiYou still mourn for Joffrey?
12245,margaeryHe was my husband. My king.
12246,cerseiHe would have been your nightmare.
12247,"margaeryYour Grace, I feel..."
12248,"cerseiYou knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
12249,margaeryNo.
12250,"cerseiThe things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
12251,"margaeryIt would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
12252,cerseiHe will need help... if he's going to rule well.
12253,margaeryHe has you.
12254,"cerseiA mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
12255,"margaeryOh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
12256,"cerseiYes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
12257,margaeryWe may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
12258,margaeryI won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
12259,jorahKing Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
12260,"barristanAnd we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
12261,daarioThe Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
12262,daenerysWho told you to take the Navy?
12263,daarioNo one.
12264,daenerysSo why did you do it?
12265,daarioI heard you liked ships.
12266,daenerysHow many ships?
12267,"barristanNinety-three, Your Grace."
12268,daenerysHow many men can they carry?
12269,"barristanNinety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
12270,daenerysWould that be enough to take King's Landing?
12271,jorahThe Lannisters have more.
12272,"barristanThey've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
12273,jorahIt's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
12274,barristanThe old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
12275,"jorahThe old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
12276,"jorahThere's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
12277,"daenerysPlease leave me. Not you, Jorah."
12278,daenerysIt appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
12279,jorahYou could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
12280,daenerysYou counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
12281,daenerysHow can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
12282,jorahYou're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
12283,daenerysI need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
12284,"jorahWhat, then?"
12285,daenerysI will do what queens do. I will rule.
12286,petyrPull up your hood. A memorable shade.
12287,sansaBut how would they know?
12288,petyrYou know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
12289,sansaIs this the only way into the Eyrie?
12290,"petyrThe mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
12291,knightWho would pass the Bloody Gate?
12292,"petyrLord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
12293,knightStand to.
12294,knightStand to!
12295,"knightWelcome back, Lord Baelish."
12296,robinUncle Petyr!
12297,petyrMy lord.
12298,petyrOh. I have brought you a gift.
12299,lysaLord Baelish.
12300,petyrMy lady.
12301,robinLook what Uncle Petyr brought me.
12302,lysaA beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
12303,"sansaIt's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
12304,"lysaOh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
12305,lysaMy flesh and blood.
12306,"sansaIt's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
12307,lysaYou mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
12308,sansaOf course. I understand.
12309,lysaNo one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
12310,sansaI would never say a thing.
12311,lysaThe Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
12312,robinMummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
12313,"sansaThey did, and my father's."
12314,"robinThey killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
12315,sansaMake him fly?
12316,robinThrough the Moon Door.
12317,"lysaAnd on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
12318,sansaThey did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
12319,lysaI don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
12320,sansaNo. We never...
12321,"lysaGood. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
12322,"sansaIt's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
12323,"lysaRobin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
12324,petyrGo. We'll speak soon.
12325,lysaWhat took you so long?
12326,"petyrArranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
12327,lysaShe's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
12328,lysaLet's get married tonight.
12329,petyrOught we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
12330,"lysaThere's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
12331,petyrI do think that we could wait until...
12332,"lysaI'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
12333,petyrLike it was yesterday.
12334,"lysaWhat wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
12335,petyrThe deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
12336,"petyrTonight it is, then."
12337,"petyrLet me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
12338,"lysaI'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
12339,tywinWhen will the wedding take place in your mind?
12340,cerseiAs soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
12341,tywinA fortnight?
12342,cerseiThat seems reasonable.
12343,"tywinNo jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
12344,tywinAnd your wedding to Loras?
12345,cerseiShortly after Tommen's.
12346,tywinShortly?
12347,cerseiA fortnight.
12348,tywinI know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
12349,cerseiWe had that in common.
12350,tywinYou don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
12351,cerseiThen whom can we trust?
12352,tywinOurselves alone.
12353,tywinThe Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
12354,cerseiRobert wasn't particularly rich.
12355,tywinRobert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
12356,cerseiI suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
12357,tywinDo you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
12358,cerseiHaven't a clue.
12359,"tywinGo on, your best guess."
12360,"cerseiPounds, tons, ounces?"
12361,tywinDoesn't matter. The answer is the same.
12362,cerseiThat can't be.
12363,tywinOur last working mine ran dry three years ago.
12364,cerseiThen how do we pay for anything?
12365,tywinThe crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
12366,cerseiHow much?
12367,tywinA tremendous amount.
12368,"cerseiThere must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
12369,tywinThe Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
12370,cerseiSomeone does work there. It is comprised of people.
12371,"tywinAnd a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
12372,"cerseiIt's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
12373,"tywinI know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
12374,cerseiI respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
12375,cerseiThe Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
12376,aryaJoffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
12377,sandorWould you shut up?
12378,aryaI can't sleep until I say the names.
12379,sandorThe names of every fucking person in Westeros?
12380,aryaOnly the ones I'm going to kill.
12381,"sandorHate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
12382,"aryaIf he were here right now, what would you do?"
12383,"sandorI'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
12384,aryaI'm almost done. Only one name left.
12385,sandorGo on.
12386,aryaThe Hound.
12387,sansaThank you.
12388,"lysaYour mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
12389,sansaReally?
12390,"lysaOh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
12391,"sansaMy mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
12392,"lysaThis is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
12393,sansaThey're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
12394,"lysaOh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
12395,sansaYes. I'm very lucky.
12396,lysaHe feels responsible for you.
12397,"sansaOh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
12398,lysaWhy? Why does he feel responsible for you?
12399,"sansaWell, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
12400,lysaLoved your mother.
12401,sansaNo.
12402,lysaThat's what you wanted to say.
12403,"sansaHe loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
12404,"lysaYour mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
12405,lysaHe hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
12406,"sansaNo, never."
12407,lysaAre you pregnant?
12408,"sansaWhat? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
12409,lysaI wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
12410,"sansaAunt Lysa, no, I-"
12411,"lysaYour young, pretty body."
12412,sansaNothing. I'm a virgin.
12413,lysaDon't lie to me.
12414,sansaYou're hurting me.
12415,lysaI'll know if you lie.
12416,"sansaI'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
12417,lysaShh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
12418,brienneDidn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
12419,"podrickYes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
12420,"briennePerhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
12421,podrickThat's a long way off.
12422,"brienneWell, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
12423,"podrickNever, my lady. I'm your squire."
12424,brienneI've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
12425,"podrickAll knights have squires, my lady."
12426,"brienneI'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
12427,"podrickI swore an oath, my lady."
12428,brienneI am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
12429,podrickI know.
12430,brienneWhat do you think will happen if you leave?
12431,podrickThey'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
12432,sandorThe hell you doing?
12433,aryaPracticing.
12434,"sandorWhat, ways to die?"
12435,aryaNo one's going to kill me.
12436,sandorThey will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
12437,aryaIt's not fighting. It's water dancing.
12438,sandorDancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
12439,"aryaThe greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
12440,"sandorBraavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
12441,aryaWhat do you know about anything?
12442,sandorI bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
12443,aryaIt was not.
12444,sandorWas? He dead?
12445,aryaYes.
12446,sandorHow?
12447,aryaHe was killed.
12448,sandorWho by?
12449,aryaMeryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
12450,sandorMeryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
12451,aryaHe was outnumbered.
12452,sandorAny boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
12453,aryaSyrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
12454,"sandorThe greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
12455,sandorYour friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
12456,oberynYour Grace.
12457,cerseiPrince Oberyn. Writing letters?
12458,"oberynA poem, actually."
12459,cerseiMay I show you the gardens?
12460,oberynI couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
12461,"cerseiNo, you couldn't."
12462,cerseiI didn't realize you were a poet.
12463,oberynNot a very good one.
12464,cerseiFor your paramour?
12465,oberynFor one of my daughters.
12466,"cerseiYou have several, don't you?"
12467,oberynEight.
12468,cerseiEight? Eight daughters?
12469,oberynThe fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
12470,cerseiBeautiful name.
12471,"oberynYes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
12472,"cerseiPerhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
12473,oberynWhich joke is that?
12474,cerseiYou're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
12475,oberynWe can avenge them.
12476,"cerseiYes, we can avenge them."
12477,oberynYou really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
12478,cerseiI know he did.
12479,oberynWe will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
12480,"cerseiWe'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
12481,"oberynThe last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
12482,cerseiI want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
12483,oberynYou have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
12484,"cerseiEverywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
12485,oberynAnything at all.
12486,cerseiThe best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
12487,oberynI will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
12488,cerseiPlease tell her... her mother misses her very much.
12489,"podrickOh, no, no, no."
12490,"podrickNo, no, no, no."
12491,podrickHells. Gods.
12492,brienneDid you remove the skin?
12493,"podrickNo, my lady."
12494,brienneHave you ever cooked a rabbit before?
12495,brienneDid you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
12496,"podrickNo, my lady. That was the cooks."
12497,brienneWhat are you doing?
12498,podrickI'm helping you with your armor.
12499,"brienneI've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
12500,brienneWhat exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
12501,podrickI brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
12502,"brienneOh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
12503,podrickI killed a man.
12504,brienneWho?
12505,podrickA Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
12506,brienneHow did you kill a Kingsguard?
12507,podrickI pushed a spear through the back of his head.
12508,brienneBloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
12509,"rastHey. Hey, get up. Get up."
12510,"manThat's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing."
12511,manAye. What we need is a girl there.
12512,manI've got to have a piss.
12513,manNow keep quiet.
12514,meeraYou need water.
12515,jojenIt doesn't matter.
12516,meeraOf course it matters.
12517,jojenYou mustn't let anything stop you.
12518,branThey already have stopped me.
12519,jojenNo. You're not here. You're far from here.
12520,meeraWhat does that mean?
12521,jojenAt the hill. A great weirwood tree.
12522,"branYou've seen it, too."
12523,"jojenMeera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
12524,branWe will.
12525,jojenThis... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
12526,meeraHow... will we know the end?
12527,jojenYou'll know.
12528,lockeBrothers.
12529,dolorousYou do move quiet.
12530,jonHow many?
12531,lockeEleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
12532,grennKarl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
12533,lockeHave you seen what I can do with a knife?
12534,grennNot yet.
12535,lockeThere's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
12536,jonWhy?
12537,"lockeThey've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
12538,grennNew moon tonight.
12539,jonGet some rest. We move at sundown.
12540,karlI've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
12541,karlGet her up.
12542,branStop.
12543,jojenStop. What are you doing?
12544,hodorHodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12545,branStop. Stop!
12546,hodorHodor. Hodor.
12547,branStop! Please.
12548,hodorHodor.
12549,"branPlease, get off her!"
12550,"branPlease! Please, leave her alone!"
12551,"branPlease, stop. Stop."
12552,branWhat are you doing? Leave her alone!
12553,branNo!
12554,"karlShh. Shh, shh, shh."
12555,karlShh.
12556,"karlYou've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
12557,"jojenIf you let my sister go, I can help you."
12558,karlYou can help me?
12559,jojenI can.
12560,karlAnd how you gonna do that?
12561,jojenI have the sight. I can see things.
12562,karlThat's very helpful.
12563,jojenThings that haven't happened yet.
12564,karlWhat a fine thing. A fine thing.
12565,karlHave you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
12566,jojenNo.
12567,karlDon't close your eyes.
12568,jojenI saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
12569,manTo arms!
12570,"rastThey're here, the Night's Watch."
12571,"lockeRescue party is here, lads. Lady."
12572,branIs Jon with you?
12573,lockeAye. I'll take you to him.
12574,lockeYou're Brandon Stark?
12575,"lockeThe little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy."
12576,bronnJon! Jon!
12577,lockeKeep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?
12578,hodorHodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.
12579,hodorHodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12580,"branHodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose."
12581,"branHodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor."
12582,"branJojen and Meera, free them. Go!"
12583,branJon.
12584,branJon!
12585,"jojenIf he sees you, he won't let you go north."
12586,branHe's my brother.
12587,jojenAnd wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.
12588,jojenYou have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
12589,branHodor.
12590,branWe need to free Summer. And we need to go.
12591,karlLord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?
12592,karlWe had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.
12593,karlYou learn how to fight in a castle?
12594,"karlSome old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?"
12595,karlHow to fight with honor?
12596,karlYou know what's wrong with honor?
12597,karlYou.
12598,jonAre you all right? Come with me. Come on.
12599,jonWe lost four brothers?
12600,doloroudFive.
12601,grennWhat the seven hells could do that to a man?
12602,jonI count ten dead mutineers.
12603,grennLocke said there were eleven of them.
12604,dolrousWhere's Rast?
12605,manHere's another.
12606,grennJon.
12607,jonWhere in seven hells? Come here.
12608,"jonI missed you, boy."
12609,dolorousWhat should we do with this lot?
12610,jonIt's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
12611,"moragMeaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way."
12612,jonYou want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
12613,moragBurn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
12614,"davosYour Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--"
12615,stannisWe've been here since midday.
12616,"davosEasterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
12617,"tychoWelcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit."
12618,"tychoWhat can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
12619,"davosThis is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
12620,"tychoThe Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
12621,stannisHe shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
12622,"tychoYes, we have heard this story."
12623,stannisIt's not a story. It's the truth.
12624,tychoThe king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
12625,stannisGold you loaned him.
12626,tychoAnd you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
12627,stannisMore than any man living.
12628,"tychoAcross the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
12629,"stannis4,000."
12630,"tychoAnd how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
12631,davos32.
12632,"tychoAnd how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
12633,stannisNone.
12634,tychoYou can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
12635,davosMy lord.
12636,"tychoI'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
12637,"davosWell, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
12638,"davosThis is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
12639,tychoThe war is over.
12640,"davosAs long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
12641,tychoSer Davos...
12642,davosHumor me.
12643,tychoTywin Lannister.
12644,davosHow old is Tywin Lannister?
12645,tycho67.
12646,"stannis67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
12647,tychoThat is a problem for another time.
12648,"davosBegging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
12649,"salladorThe lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, ""Bring me my red shirt."" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, ""Two pirate ships!"" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, ""Bring me my red shirt!"""
12650,"salladorAfter the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"" The captain replies, ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."" The next morning the lookout screams, ""10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!"" The crew goes silent."
12651,"salladorThey all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows..."
12652,womenBring me my brown pants!
12653,davosYou think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
12654,salladorDavos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
12655,davosOnly half rotted.
12656,"salladorJoin us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--"
12657,lharaI am Lhara.
12658,"salladorShe's an artist, this one, truly."
12659,"davosNo time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise."
12660,salladorWe?
12661,"davosYou, me-- we."
12662,salladorOnce I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
12663,davosYou won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
12664,davosThere's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
12665,"salladorYou're not my friend, my friend."
12666,davosI'll see you at sunrise.
12667,"yaraI give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."
12668,myrandaYes!
12669,"yaraThey skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you."
12670,myrandaYes! Yes!
12671,"yaraAs long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing."
12672,firstGo left.
12673,yaraTheon Greyjoy.
12674,boltonI don't know--
12675,yaraI'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
12676,boltonHe's not in the dungeons.
12677,boltonLast cage on the right.
12678,yaraThank you.
12679,yaraThis way!
12680,yaraWe're going home.
12681,theonNo!
12682,"yaraIt's all right. It's me, Yara."
12683,theonYou can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
12684,"yaraI'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you."
12685,theonNot Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
12686,firstThey're here.
12687,"yaraIf they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him."
12688,"theonNo, you can't! You can't!"
12689,yaraYou're Theon Greyjoy.
12690,"theonNo, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!"
12691,ramsayThis is turning into a lovely evening.
12692,theonI'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
12693,yaraAah! Theon!
12694,yaraGive me my brother and no more of your men will die.
12695,ramsayYou've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
12696,ramsayhow fast can you run?
12697,"yaraMake for the ship, now."
12698,ironbornBut your brother.
12699,yaraMy brother is dead.
12700,ramsayI have a treat for you. A reward.
12701,theonReward?
12702,"ramsayYes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal."
12703,theonI-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--
12704,"ramsayYes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now."
12705,"ramsayThe britches, too, Reek. Take them off."
12706,"ramsayDo you love me, Reek?"
12707,"theonYes, of course, my lord."
12708,"ramsayGood. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back."
12709,theonBut how can--
12710,ramsayI need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
12711,theonPretend to be who?
12712,ramsayTheon Greyjoy.
12713,"daenerysYou stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend."
12714,missandeiThe Queen says you may approach and speak.
12715,missandeiHe is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
12716,daenerysI thank him for his prayers.
12717,"missandeiIt was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock."
12718,"missandeiHe hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing."
12719,"daenerysTell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,"
12720,daenerysbut I will see he is paid their value three times over.
12721,daenerysSend the next one in.
12722,manservantThe noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
12723,daenerysThe noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
12724,hizdahrQueen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
12725,daenerysI thank you.
12726,hizdahrMine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
12727,daenerysThen it is my honor to receive you.
12728,"hizdahrMy father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included."
12729,"daenerysFor that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him."
12730,"hizdahrYou have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly."
12731,daenerysYour father crucified innocent children.
12732,"hizdahrMy father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"
12733,"daenerysI am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
12734,hizdahrWhat's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
12735,daenerysAnd what traditions do you speak of?
12736,"hizdahrThe tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
12737,"hizdahrYour Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials."
12738,daenerysAnd what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
12739,"hizdahrYour Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."
12740,"daenerysBury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
12741,"hizdahrThank you, my queen."
12742,daenerysHow many more?
12743,"missandeiThere are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace."
12744,daenerys212?
12745,"oberynThese meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?"
12746,maceLord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
12747,"maceLord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--"
12748,tywinThe trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
12749,"varysSandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
12750,cerseiA coward and a traitor.
12751,"varysMy birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
12752,pycelleDisgraceful.
12753,tywinWhat would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
12754,varys10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
12755,tywinMake it 100. What else?
12756,"varysMore whispers from the east, my lord."
12757,tywinThe Targaryen girl?
12758,varysDaenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
12759,cerseiConquered with what?
12760,"varysShe commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
12761,"cerseiBaby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
12762,pycelleMormont is spying on her for us.
12763,"varysNo longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
12764,cerseiHe's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
12765,tywinJoffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
12766,cerseiDon't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
12767,"varysA child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
12768,oberynLord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
12769,tywinDragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
12770,"pycelleHow, my lord? By force?"
12771,"tywinEventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
12772,"varysMost certainly, my Lord Hand."
12773,"tywinMmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
12774,varysPrince Oberyn.
12775,oberynLord Varys...
12776,varysOnly Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
12777,oberynAnd yet everyone does.
12778,varysYou seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
12779,oberynFive years.
12780,varysMay I ask why?
12781,oberynTis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
12782,varysMost of us aren't princes.
12783,oberynYou are from Essos. Where? Lys?
12784,varysI have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
12785,oberynI have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
12786,varysIt's a long story.
12787,oberynOne you don't like telling people.
12788,varysPeople I trust.
12789,"oberynMy paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
12790,oberynYou did like boys before?
12791,oberynReally? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
12792,"varysNot at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
12793,oberynWhat then?
12794,varysNothing.
12795,oberynEverybody is interested in something.
12796,"varysNot me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
12797,oberynSuch as?
12798,"tyrionLet me guess, I've been pardoned."
12799,tyrionReally?
12800,jaimeFather's orders.
12801,"tyrionWell, we mustn't disappoint Father."
12802,manKingslayer!
12803,"tommenI, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
12804,"tywinTyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
12805,tyrionNo.
12806,"tywinDid your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
12807,tyrionNot that I know of.
12808,"tywinHow would you say he died, then?"
12809,tyrionChoked on his pigeon pie.
12810,tywinSo you would blame the bakers?
12811,tyrionOr the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
12812,tywinThe crown may call its first witness.
12813,"merynOnce we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
12814,"tyrionOh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
12815,tywinSilence.
12816,tyrionPointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
12817,"tywinSilence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
12818,"pycelleBasilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--"
12819,"oberynI think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
12820,"pycelleHad, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
12821,tywinBy whom?
12822,"pycelleBy the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
12823,"tywinGrand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
12824,pycelleWithout question.
12825,"pycelleThis was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
12826,tywinWas this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
12827,pyelleIt was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
12828,cerseiI will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
12829,maceYour own brother said this to you?
12830,"cerseiShortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
12831,"oberynTyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
12832,cerseiI discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
12833,"tywinThank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
12834,maceDo you remember the precise nature of this threat?
12835,"varysI'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
12836,maceAnd he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
12837,varysYes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
12838,"tywinYou're excused, Lord Varys."
12839,"tyrionFather, may I ask the witness one question?"
12840,tywinOne.
12841,"tyrionYou once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
12842,"varysSadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
12843,tywinWe will adjourn for now.
12844,tywinToll the bells in an hour's time.
12845,guardClear the court!
12846,jaimeYou'd condemn your own son to death?
12847,tywinI've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
12848,jaimeThis isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
12849,tywinI know nothing of the sort.
12850,jaimeYou've always hated Tyrion.
12851,tywinHe killed his king.
12852,jaimeAs did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
12853,tywinIt won't be murder. It'll be justice.
12854,jaimeJustice?
12855,"tywinI'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
12856,jaimeHe'll be executed.
12857,"tywinNo, he'll be punished accordingly."
12858,"jaimeOnce you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
12859,tywinI'm well aware of your oath.
12860,jaimeWhat happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
12861,tywinWhat happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
12862,jaimeIt survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
12863,tywinDone.
12864,"tywinWhen the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
12865,jaimeYou have my word.
12866,tywinAnd you have mine.
12867,"tyrionNot going well, is it?"
12868,jaimeYou're going to be found guilty.
12869,"tyrionOh, you think so?"
12870,"jaimeWhen you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
12871,tyrionNed Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
12872,jaimeFather is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
12873,tyrionHow do you know?
12874,jaimeDo you trust me?
12875,jaimeKeep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
12876,tywinThe crown may call its next witness.
12877,tywinState your name.
12878,shaeShae.
12879,tywinDo you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
12880,shaeI swear it.
12881,tywinDo you know this man?
12882,shaeYes. Tyrion Lannister.
12883,tywinHow do you know him?
12884,shaeI was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
12885,tywinThis man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
12886,shaeI know that he's guilty.
12887,shaeHe and Sansa planned it together.
12888,tywinSilence! Continue.
12889,"shaeShe wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
12890,shaeHe stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
12891,oberynHow could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
12892,shaeI wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
12893,maceI beg your pardon? You said you were his...
12894,shaeHis whore.
12895,tywinHow did you come to be in his service?
12896,"shaeHe stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
12897,tywinSilence. Silence!
12898,oberynAnd did you?
12899,shaeDid I what?
12900,oberynFuck him like it was his last night in this world.
12901,"shaeI did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
12902,tyrionShae. Please don't.
12903,"shaeI am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
12904,"tyrionFather, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
12905,tywinYou wish to confess?
12906,tyrionI saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
12907,tywinTyrion. Do you wish to confess?
12908,"tyrionYes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
12909,tywinYou admit you poisoned the king?
12910,"tyrionNo, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
12911,tywinYou are not on trial for being a dwarf.
12912,"tyrionOh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
12913,tywinHave you nothing to say in your defense?
12914,"tyrionNothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
12915,"tyrionWatching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
12916,tyrionI wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
12917,tywinSer Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
12918,tyrionI will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
12919,jaimeI made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
12920,"tyrionI'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
12921,"jaimeYou threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
12922,"tyrionOf course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
12923,jaimeYou fell in love with a whore.
12924,"tyrionYes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
12925,jaimeCareful. I'm the last friend you've got.
12926,tyrionAt least I got to tell them what they really are.
12927,"jaimeYes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
12928,"tyrionDon't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
12929,jaimeI can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
12930,"tyrionWhere's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
12931,tyrionOur family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
12932,jaimeIt is tempting.
12933,"tyrionWell... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
12934,jaimeIf he wins.
12935,tyrionWill you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
12936,jaimeNo. Not Ser Meryn.
12937,"guardGo on, move it."
12938,guardAnd you. Come on.
12939,"prisonerMercy. Please. Please, mercy."
12940,cerseiSer Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
12941,cerseiYou seem to be in good form.
12942,mountainWho am I fighting?
12943,cerseiDoes it matter?
12944,sandorCould be food.
12945,aryaCould be soldiers.
12946,aryaYou shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
12947,"dyingWhere else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
12948,"sandorWho were ""they""?"
12949,dyingI stopped asking a while ago.
12950,sandorThat's not gonna get better.
12951,dyingDoesn't seem so.
12952,sandorA bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
12953,dyingOf what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
12954,aryaSo why go on?
12955,dyingHabit.
12956,aryaNothing could be worse than this.
12957,dyingMaybe nothing is worse than this.
12958,aryaNothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
12959,dyingWho are you?
12960,aryaMy name is Arya. Arya Stark.
12961,dyingYou her father?
12962,sandorHer captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
12963,"dyingA fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
12964,dyingWish it were wine.
12965,sandorSo do I.
12966,sandorThat's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
12967,sandorThe fuck you doing?
12968,rorgeThere's a price on your head.
12969,sandorGuess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
12970,rorgeThe king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
12971,"sandorAnd you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
12972,aryaYou were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
12973,sandorThis day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
12974,aryaHe can't be. I don't know his name.
12975,sandorWhat's your name?
12976,rorgeRorge.
12977,aryaThank you.
12978,sandorYou're learning.
12979,manRangers returning!
12980,manThey return!
12981,jonGreetings.
12982,manDidn't think I'd see you again.
12983,"samAll right, Jon?"
12984,"manWelcome back, brother."
12985,alliserLord Snow.
12986,alliserThis is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
12987,"jonCome on, Ghost."
12988,jonMance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
12989,"janosI'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
12990,jonWe need to prepare.
12991,alliserWe've been preparing.
12992,jonWe should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
12993,alliserAnd how would we range north?
12994,jonWe wouldn't.
12995,"alliserCoward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
12996,grennWe can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
12997,"alliserThis castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
12998,"jonHave you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
12999,alliserThe bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13000,jonThey won't stop them.
13001,"alliserRemind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13002,jonThe stewards.
13003,alliserAre the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13004,jonNo.
13005,alliserWho would that be?
13006,jonThe builders.
13007,"alliserAh, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13008,yarwickNo.
13009,"alliserGiven your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13010,"alliserMoving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13011,yarwickAye.
13012,bronnMy lord.
13013,tyrionYou have new clothes.
13014,bronnDo you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13015,tyrionI sent for you days ago.
13016,bronnI've been a bit busy.
13017,tyrionDoing what?
13018,bronnMy lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13019,tyrionLollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13020,bronnI wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13021,tyrionShe's dim-witted.
13022,"bronnIf I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13023,"tyrionWhen my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13024,"bronnFalyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13025,tyrionAnd you understand the rules of inheritance?
13026,bronnFalyse is forty and barren.
13027,tyrionShe still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13028,bronnShe does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13029,bronnWhat? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13030,tyrionYou and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13031,"bronnYou once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13032,tyrionIs it two wives you want or two castles?
13033,"bronnOne of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13034,tyrionI'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13035,bronnI have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13036,tyrionYou might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13037,"bronnYour sister's a Lannister, too."
13038,"tyrionMy wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13039,"bronnIf and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13040,tyrionDoes he frighten you so much?
13041,"bronnI'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13042,tyrionBecause you're my friend.
13043,"bronnAye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13044,"bronnI like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13045,tyrionI understand.
13046,bronnI'm sorry it has to be this way.
13047,tyrionWhy are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13048,bronnWe had some good days together.
13049,"tyrionYes, we did."
13050,bronnWhat will you do?
13051,tyrionI suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13052,bronnI hope to hear them sing it one day.
13053,"daenerysHow did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13054,daarioBut your window is not.
13055,daarioI swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13056,daenerysDon't do that again.
13057,daarioNever met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13058,"daenerysThese are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13059,"daarioForgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13060,daenerysTell me why you're here.
13061,"daarioI came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13062,daenerysI've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13063,daarioYou've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13064,"daenerysAnd as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13065,"daarioThere is only one, and she does not want me."
13066,daenerysYou swore me your sword.
13067,daarioMy sword is yours till the day I die.
13068,daenerysSo if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13069,daarioI'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13070,daenerysVery well.
13071,daenerysDo what you do best.
13072,daenerysTake off your clothes.
13073,selyseOh.
13074,"melisandreCome in, my queen. Please."
13075,"selyseI didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13076,melisandreYou could never disturb me.
13077,selyseI just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13078,melisandreCould you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13079,"melisandreNo, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13080,"melisandreWhen I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13081,selyseIt was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13082,melisandreThat's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13083,"selyseIf they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13084,melisandreNot always.
13085,"melisandreMost of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13086,selyseDid you use it with Stannis?
13087,melisandreNo. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13088,melisandreIt's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13089,"selyseNo act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13090,melisandreI understand how you feel.
13091,selyseHmm.
13092,melisandreBut that is impossible.
13093,selyseWhy?
13094,"melisandreYou don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
13095,"melisandreHowever harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13096,daarioJorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13097,jorahKhaleesi.
13098,daenerysYou're here early.
13099,jorahLater than some.
13100,daenerysYou don't approve?
13101,"jorahIt's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13102,daenerysYou neither approve nor trust.
13103,jorahWhy would I? The man's a sellsword.
13104,daenerysDidn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13105,jorahI did.
13106,daenerysI trust you.
13107,jorahDaario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13108,daenerysI could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13109,jorahYou have?
13110,daenerysI have.
13111,"jorahWithout you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13112,"daenerysThat is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13113,"jorahHerding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13114,daenerysAnd repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13115,"jorahIt's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13116,daenerysLet the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13117,"jorahI sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13118,daenerysAnd now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13119,jorahI wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13120,daenerysThe man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13121,jorahHizdahr zo Loraq?
13122,daenerysHe will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13123,"daenerysWell, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13124,"jorahYes, Khaleesi."
13125,daenerysNo. Tell him you changed my mind.
13126,sandorRat cunts. Fucking whore.
13127,"aryaYou're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13128,sandorNo fire.
13129,aryaIt'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13130,sandorNo fire!
13131,"sandorShut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13132,"sandorI'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13133,sandorMy brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13134,aryaWhy?
13135,"sandorThought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13136,aryaLet me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13137,brienneBit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13138,"podrickCouldn't agree more, my lady."
13139,brienneJust don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13140,"podrickYes, my lady."
13141,brienneDon't get drunk.
13142,"podrickNo, my lady."
13143,hotCan I get you anything else?
13144,"brienneNo, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13145,hotThanks. I do my best.
13146,"hotA good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13147,brienneNo.
13148,"hotOh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13149,brienneWe're looking for someone.
13150,hotSomeone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13151,"brienneA girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13152,"hotStarks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13153,"hotNo, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13154,brienneI pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13155,hotSure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13156,brienneWhat?
13157,"podrickIt's nothing, my lady."
13158,brienneYou wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13159,"podrickDon't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13160,brienneYou're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13161,podrickThe Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13162,hotMy lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13163,brienneWhat about? Not kidney pie.
13164,hotYou seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13165,brienneNo one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13166,hotShe weren't when I last spoke to her.
13167,brienneWhen was that?
13168,"hotHeading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13169,brienneSo what happened to her?
13170,hotWell-
13171,brienneThe quick version.
13172,hotThe Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13173,podrickThe Hound.
13174,"hotThat's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13175,"brienneUm, you were saying?"
13176,"brienneHer mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13177,"podrickThey'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13178,brienneWhy the Eyrie?
13179,"podrickHer aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13180,"brienneSansa could be there, too."
13181,"podrickAye, my lady. Could be."
13182,brienneYou sure about this?
13183,podrickNo.
13184,tyrionI imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13185,oberynI did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13186,"tyrionMm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13187,oberynYour sister.
13188,tyrionOh.
13189,oberynCersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13190,tyrionMaking honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13191,oberynIt was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13192,tyrionShe didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13193,"oberynYes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13194,tyrionI think I would have remembered that.
13195,"oberynUnlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13196,tyrionYou and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13197,"oberynThe whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13198,tyrionThat would have made things so much easier.
13199,"oberynWhen we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13200,"tyrionWell... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13201,oberynAnd what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13202,"tyrionIf you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13203,oberynI disagree.
13204,"oberynI've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13205,"sansaHello, Robin."
13206,robinWhat are you doing?
13207,"sansaI'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13208,robinWhy did you leave?
13209,sansaIt's a long story.
13210,robinI stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13211,"sansaYes, you certainly are."
13212,robinWhen will you go back?
13213,sansaProbably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13214,robinOh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13215,"sansaNo, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13216,robinThat sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13217,sansaWe don't.
13218,robinWhat do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13219,sansaI never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13220,"robinWell, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13221,sansaI like the sound of that.
13222,robinLet's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13223,sansaAll right.
13224,robinIt can go in here in this big tower.
13225,sansaCareful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13226,robinI didn't ruin it.
13227,sansaYou did.
13228,robinIt was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13229,sansaKnocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13230,robinI didn't ruin it!
13231,sansaYou're being stupid.
13232,"sansaRobin, I'm sorry, I-"
13233,petyrChildren.
13234,sansaI hit him.
13235,"petyrYes, I saw."
13236,sansaI shouldn't have done that.
13237,"petyrNo, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13238,sansaIf he tells Aunt Lysa...
13239,petyrLet me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13240,sansaI was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13241,"petyrA lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13242,sansaWhy did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
13243,"petyrI loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
13244,petyrYou're more beautiful than she ever was.
13245,sansaLord Baelish...
13246,petyrCall me Petyr.
13247,"sansaYou wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
13248,"lysaCome here, Sansa."
13249,lysaDo you know how far the fall is?
13250,sansaNo.
13251,"lysaNeither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
13252,"sansaI'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
13253,"lysaDon't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
13254,sansaI didn't. You don't understand.
13255,lysaI saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
13256,sansaHe kissed me. I pulled away.
13257,lysaLiar! Whore! He is mine!
13258,sansaPlease!
13259,"lysaMy father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
13260,petyrLysa! Let her go.
13261,lysaYou want her? This empty-headed child?
13262,petyrLet her go.
13263,lysaShe's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
13264,"petyrI'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
13265,"petyrOh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
13266,"petyrI have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
13267,manHere we are.
13268,manThe Rains of Castamere!
13269,"molesYou fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
13270,"manOh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
13271,"molesThere's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
13272,gillyYes.
13273,"molesWell, what are you going to say?"
13274,gillyI'm sorry it woke you up.
13275,"molesI don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
13276,gillyDon't you ever touch him.
13277,"molesHehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
13278,gillyShut your mouth.
13279,molesWhat? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
13280,gillyNo it's not.
13281,samI should never have left her there.
13282,jonYou couldn't have known.
13283,samOf course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
13284,grennAnd we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
13285,edOur brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
13286,"grennOh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
13287,edI didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
13288,grennWe pledged to guard the realms of men.
13289,samShe's dead because of me.
13290,grennWe can't even guard Mole's Town.
13291,"jonWe can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
13292,samLittle Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
13293,"pypMaybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
13294,edShe survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
13295,samShe might have.
13296,"jonIf they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
13297,edA hundred thousand.
13298,"grennAnd there's what, 5 of us left."
13299,"edIf you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
13300,pypHow do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
13301,"edWhoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
13302,daenerysYou think he was spying on you?
13303,"missandeiNo, not spying."
13304,daenerysThe Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
13305,missandeiYes your grace.
13306,daenerysBut you are not Dothraki.
13307,missandeiNo.
13308,"daenerysWell, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
13309,missandeiHe was interested.
13310,daenerysWhat?
13311,missandeiI believe he was interested.
13312,"daenerysWhen the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
13313,missandeiAll of it?
13314,daenerysThe...the pillar an the stones.
13315,"missandeiI don't know, your grace."
13316,daenerysHaven't you ever wondered?
13317,"missandeiYes, your grace."
13318,greyMissandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
13319,missandeiin Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
13320,greyin Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
13321,missandeiin Valyrian* No.
13322,"greyThe lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
13323,missandeiTo me.
13324,greyTo me.
13325,missandeiI don't remember teaching you the word precious.
13326,"greyJorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
13327,missandeiDo you remember the name you were given at birth?
13328,greyI remember nothing. Only unsullied.
13329,"missandeiWhen they cut you, do you remember that?"
13330,missandeiI'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
13331,greyWhy? Why sorry?
13332,missandeiIt's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
13333,"greyapproaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
13334,missandeiin Valyrian* Grey Worm.
13335,missandeiin Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
13336,greyin Valyrian* So am I.
13337,"ramsayBracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
13338,"theonI'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
13339,ramsayAnd what are you really?
13340,theonI'm Reek.
13341,"ramsayAre you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
13342,ramsayUntil when?
13343,theonAlways. Forever.
13344,ramsayThat's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
13345,guardto Theon* No closer. Who are you?
13346,"ralfI'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
13347,theonYes.
13348,ralfAnd why should I believe that?
13349,theonI was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
13350,everyoneWhat is dead may never die.
13351,"ralfAnd if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
13352,theonLord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
13353,ralfAnd what does Lord Bolton want?
13354,theonYou are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
13355,ralfHe wants us to surrender?
13356,"theonMy own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
13357,ralfshame fought with honor.
13358,"theonI'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
13359,ralfNo shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
13360,theonscared* You don't know.
13361,ralfThe Ironborn will not surrender.
13362,theonwhispering* Reek. Reek.
13363,"ralfYou go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
13364,theonReek.
13365,"manIf we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
13366,theonYes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
13367,"ramsayYou didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
13368,theonYes m'lord. Will we go home now?
13369,ramsayI believe we will. To our new home.
13370,"petyrA great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
13371,lordOur forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
13372,"petyrThe beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
13373,"lordShe told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
13374,petyrMy lord...
13375,"lordAnd when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
13376,petyrLady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
13377,"ladyYes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
13378,petyrOf course. Her suicide shattered us all.
13379,ladyShe was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
13380,"lordStrange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
13381,petyrShe was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
13382,lordWe were told there was a witness. A girl.
13383,"ladyA niece of yours, I believe."
13384,"petyrA girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
13385,lordWe'd like to speak with her.
13386,petyrLet me fetch her.
13387,ladyNo need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
13388,"ladyCome closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
13389,petyrMy lady...
13390,ladyI wasn't asking you.
13391,sansaHe can stay.
13392,"lordSpeak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
13393,"sansato Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
13394,"ladyPlease, Alayne, leave nothing out."
13395,"sansaMy name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
13396,"lordSansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
13397,"sansaLord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
13398,"serYour secret is safe with us, my lady."
13399,lordYour father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
13400,"ladyTell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
13401,"sansaYou knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
13402,lordLady Sansa.
13403,"sansaIt was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
13404,"ladyShh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
13405,lordYou could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
13406,ladyLord Royce! This is hardly the time.
13407,"lordApologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
13408,"petyrYou want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
13409,"ladyNot much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
13410,"petyrFor Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
13411,lordAre you questioning our courage?
13412,"petyrI want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
13413,lordOf course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
13414,"petyrNo? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
13415,"ladyWho would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
13416,"petyrI'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
13417,ladyRobin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
13418,petyrAnd sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
13419,ladyMore often they die young.
13420,"petyrI adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
13421,"lordAye, it's time."
13422,"petyrYes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
13423,boySer Barristan.
13424,serYes? Who sent you?
13425,serSer Barristan.
13426,serSer Jorah.
13427,serHave I forgotten a council meeting?
13428,serNo.
13429,serWhat's this?
13430,serA royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
13431,serWho gave you this?
13432,serDoes it matter?
13433,serHave you told her?
13434,"serI wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
13435,serLet me speak with her in private.
13436,serYou'll never be alone with her again.
13437,daenerysWhy did the usurper pardon you?
13438,serIf we could speak alone.
13439,"daenerysNo, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
13440,"serWho do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
13441,daenerysThe pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
13442,serIt is not forged.
13443,"daenerysWhy, then?"
13444,"serI sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
13445,daenerysWhat was the content of these letters?
13446,serInformation.
13447,daenerysWhat information?
13448,serWhen you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
13449,daenerysYou told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13450,serI...
13451,daenerysYes or no?
13452,serKhaleesi.
13453,daenerysDon't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13454,serYes.
13455,daenerysThat wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
13456,serI stopped you from drinking his wine.
13457,daenerysBecause you knew it was poisoned.
13458,serI suspected.
13459,daenerysYou betrayed me from the first.
13460,"serForgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
13461,daenerysYou sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
13462,serI have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
13463,daenerysand you want me to forgive you?
13464,serI have loved you.
13465,"daenerysLove? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
13466,"serDaenerys, please."
13467,"daenerysDon't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
13468,"ramsayMoat Cailin is yours, Father."
13469,lordWalk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
13470,ramsayNo.
13471,"ramsayUnimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
13472,"ramsayMoors, fields, hills."
13473,ramsayTell me what you see.
13474,ramsayNothing.
13475,"rooseNot nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
13476,ramsayRamsay Snow.
13477,"rooseNo, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
13478,"ramsayYou honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
13479,"ramsayCome, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
13480,sansaYes?
13481,"petyrFirst time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
13482,sansaThey would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
13483,petyrThat's not an answer.
13484,"sansaIf they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
13485,petyrI don't know.
13486,sansaNeither do I.
13487,petyrBetter to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
13488,sansaI know what you want.
13489,petyrDo you?
13490,"sandorI thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
13491,aryaLots of things make me happy.
13492,sandorLike what?
13493,"aryaKilling Polliver, killing Rorge."
13494,sandorSo you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
13495,aryaAt least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
13496,"sandorAye, nothing in the world beats that look."
13497,aryaYou protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
13498,"sandorI wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
13499,aryaThat's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
13500,sandorlaughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
13501,aryaYou should have let me burn it.
13502,sandorIt's a fleabite.
13503,aryaThat fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
13504,"sandorWell, we won't have to walk too much further."
13505,aryaYou really think my aunt will pay for me?
13506,"sandorAye, she'll pay."
13507,aryaI've never even met her.
13508,"sandorDoesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
13509,aryaI'm not a lady.
13510,guardWho would pass the Bloody Gate?
13511,"sandorThe bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
13512,guardThen I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
13513,"robinI've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
13514,petyrYou shouldn't be.
13515,"robinThe Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
13516,petyrIt wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
13517,sansaShall we go?
13518,tyrionWine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
13519,jaimeSoon.
13520,"tyrionDo you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
13521,jaimeI've never seen him fight.
13522,"tyrionOh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
13523,jaimeOberyn believes in himself.
13524,tyrionThat's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
13525,jaimeBeheading.
13526,"tyrionSeems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
13527,jaimeCousins.
13528,"tyrionCousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
13529,jaimeOf course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
13530,tyrionSimple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
13531,togetherKhuu! Khuu! Khuu!
13532,tyrionNothing made him happier.
13533,jaimeNothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
13534,tyrionOn the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
13535,"jaimeThe joke wore thin, though."
13536,tyrionFor you. You drifted away.
13537,jaimeI had other interests.
13538,"tyrionYes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
13539,jaimeWhy?
13540,"tyrionI was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
13541,jaimeVolarik. Tried to touch me once.
13542,"tyrionTurns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
13543,"jaimeEvery day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
13544,"tyrionI know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
13545,jaimeHe was twice your size.
13546,"tyrionHe just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
13547,jaimeI don't know.
13548,jaimeGood luck today.
13549,tyrionLooks like very light armor.
13550,oberynI like to move around.
13551,tyrionYou could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
13552,oberynYou learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
13553,tyrionIt could get you killed. It could get me killed.
13554,oberynToday is not the day I die.
13555,ellariaYou're going to fight that?
13556,oberynI'm going to kill that.
13557,ellariaHe is the biggest man I've ever seen.
13558,oberynSize does not matter when you are flat on your back.
13559,tyrionThank the gods.
13560,"pycellIn the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
13561,ellariaDon't leave me alone in this world.
13562,oberynNever.
13563,oberynHave they told you who I am?
13564,mountainSome dead man.
13565,oberynI am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
13566,oberynI'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
13567,oberynSay it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
13568,oberynYou raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
13569,oberynYou raped her! You murdered her!
13570,oberynYou killed her children!
13571,"oberynWait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
13572,mountainElia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
13573,"tywinstanding up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
13574,samWhat was she like?
13575,jonShe...she had red hair.
13576,samOh? How big were her feet?
13577,jonWell what do you want me to say?
13578,samI want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
13579,jonSo you and Gilly never-
13580,samNo...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
13581,"jonBut if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
13582,"samThe interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
13583,jonWhat?
13584,"samI shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
13585,jonI don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
13586,"samAnyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
13587,"jonIt's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
13588,"samNo, you're really not."
13589,jonAnd what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
13590,samThere'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
13591,jonThere will.
13592,samThey've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
13593,"jonGo get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
13594,tormundDid I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
13595,ygritteYes.
13596,"tormundOh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
13597,ygritteI know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
13598,tormundWe could be waiting here a while.
13599,"ygritteGood. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
13600,styrYou've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
13601,"ygritteBack in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
13602,styrYes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
13603,ygritteI probably killed him already.
13604,styrSo you've said.
13605,ygritteAnd if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
13606,styrAnd more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
13607,"ygritteWhat, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
13608,styrMaybe I have.
13609,"ygritteJon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
13610,"aemonAnd what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
13611,samMaester Aemon. How did you know-
13612,aemonThat it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
13613,samLet me help you.
13614,"aemonOh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
13615,samMaester Faull
13616,"aemonAh, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
13617,samBut what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
13618,aemonYes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
13619,samI don't love her.
13620,aemonYes you do.
13621,samNo.
13622,aemonYes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
13623,samYou were?
13624,"aemonYou can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
13625,"samI'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
13626,aemonYou know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
13627,samWho was she?
13628,aemonAh ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
13629,"pypI'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
13630,"gillyThey killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
13631,"pypI'm sorry, I can't."
13632,"gillyIf they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
13633,samPyp! Open the gate.
13634,pypI can't.
13635,"gillySam, is that you?!"
13636,samYes!
13637,pypThorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
13638,"samOh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
13639,pypI've never heard you curse before.
13640,"samYes, well, best get used to it."
13641,"samAre you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
13642,gillyIt was horrible.
13643,samI'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
13644,"gillyDon't let them send me away, Sam."
13645,samNever.
13646,gillyI know there's no women allowed.
13647,"samAnyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
13648,alliserGet ready!
13649,thennIt's time.
13650,janosPick up the pace!
13651,"jonThere we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
13652,alliserA hundred thousand you say?
13653,jonYes sir.
13654,alliserYou can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
13655,"jonIt was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
13656,"alliserDo you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
13657,samYou'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
13658,gillyYou're leaving me again?
13659,samI'm not leaving you!
13660,gillyYou're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
13661,samI...I didn't mean in the same room.
13662,gillyWhat are you going to do out there?
13663,samHelp my brothers.
13664,gillyHow?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
13665,samI can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
13666,"gillyWhy not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
13667,"samLook. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
13668,gillyPromise me you won't die.
13669,samI promise you I won't die.
13670,samThere's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
13671,pypI've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
13672,"samOf course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
13673,"pypWell if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
13674,"samI didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
13675,pypBut you're afraid now?
13676,"samYes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
13677,ygritteMost of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
13678,styrHow high are the walls?
13679,"ygritteWell, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
13680,tormundLet's kill some Crows!
13681,tormundyells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
13682,"alliserArchers knock, everyone else hold."
13683,alliserI said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
13684,nightsNo Ser!
13685,alliserDoes fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
13686,alliserYou all plan to die here tonight?
13687,alliserThat's very good to hear. Draw!
13688,"memberHelp, down below."
13689,janosThey're attacking the southern gates!
13690,alliserNow?
13691,janosNow!
13692,"alliserI'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
13693,janosWhat?!
13694,"alliserWhat are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
13695,janosYou heard the man. Loose!
13696,"tormundYou, over there."
13697,samDid you get one?
13698,"pypNo. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
13699,samYeah?
13700,pypI think we're gonna die.
13701,samIf you keep missing we will.
13702,alliserBrothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
13703,nightsNo!
13704,"alliserTonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
13705,alliserThe Night's Watch will stand.
13706,"alliserWith me now! Now, with me!"
13707,"janosNo discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
13708,jonWe can't just let them attack the gate!
13709,"janosThe bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
13710,"jonThose are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
13711,janosNo such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
13712,"grennBrother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
13713,janosNeeded below? Yes. Yes.
13714,jonArchers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
13715,jonThey won't summit before dawn.
13716,grennHow do you know that?
13717,jonBecause I've made that claim.
13718,edI think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
13719,jonKnock! Draw! Loose!
13720,"pypI got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
13721,"samOh, is it over?"
13722,pypHuh?
13723,samWell then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
13724,"samYou're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
13725,jonNow!
13726,edNow!
13727,"jonto Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
13728,grennAlright.
13729,jongrabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
13730,"grennThey won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!"
13731,jonOil!
13732,edOil on the ramp!
13733,alliserProtect the gate!
13734,alliserHold the fucking gate! Hold it!
13735,samto Grenn* We need more men down here.
13736,grennWe have to hold the gate.
13737,samBut we need men here.
13738,grennTell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
13739,samto Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
13740,"samYour name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
13741,"samAnd find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
13742,jonWhat are you doing up here?
13743,samThe Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
13744,"jonEd. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
13745,jonTwo brothers now fight with me.
13746,"edMight as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
13747,donnelHow are we gonna stop that?
13748,cooperWe shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
13749,"grennYou heard Jon, we hold the gate."
13750,donnelJon Snow's not Lord Commander.
13751,grennWe hold the gate!
13752,donnelMother save me. Father save me.
13753,"grennThe gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
13754,"donnelNo, please."
13755,"grennNight gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
13756,"allAnd win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!"
13757,jonto Sam* I don't want you out there.
13758,samYou can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
13759,jonI need him more than I need you.
13760,samWe need you boy.
13761,ygritteJon Snow.
13762,"jonNo, shh, don't talk."
13763,ygritteDo you remember that cave?
13764,ygritteWe shouldo ve stayed in that cave.
13765,jonWe'll go back there.
13766,"ygritteYou know nothing, Jon Snow."
13767,"edDrop the scythe, boys!"
13768,edHoister up!
13769,edThey've had enough for one night.
13770,edDon't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
13771,"jonTormund. It's over, let it end."
13772,tormundThis is how a man ends.
13773,jonPut him in chains. We'll question him later.
13774,tormundI shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
13775,"jonAye, you shouldo ve."
13776,"samWoah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
13777,samWe held them off.
13778,jonFor one night.
13779,samThis is a great victory.
13780,"jonGreat victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
13781,samWhere are you going?
13782,jonI'm going to find Mance.
13783,samTo...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
13784,"jonWho's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
13785,samWithout Mance? You're going to kill him?
13786,jonI'm going to try.
13787,"samThey'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
13788,jonHe'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
13789,samHe won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
13790,jonYou're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
13791,"jonThey held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
13792,samWhat are you doing?
13793,jonI promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
13794,samJon. Come back.
13795,manceYou're wearing a black cloak again.
13796,jonI've been sent to negotiate with you.
13797,"manceIt appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
13798,"jonThe Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
13799,"manceAll of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
13800,jonShe put three arrows in me when I escaped.
13801,manceDid you see her again at Castle Black?
13802,jonYes.
13803,manceAnd?
13804,jonShe's dead.
13805,manceYour doing?
13806,jonNo.
13807,manceWe'll drink to her.
13808,"manceOf all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
13809,manceYgritte.
13810,jonYgritte.
13811,jonThat's not wine.
13812,"manceNo, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
13813,jonHe's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
13814,manceHe was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
13815,jonGrenn came from a farm.
13816,manceMag and Grenn.
13817,jonGrenn and Mag.
13818,"manceKullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
13819,jonTurn your army around and go home.
13820,manceYou know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
13821,jonI told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
13822,"manceI showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
13823,"manceAh! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
13824,manceYou attacking us?
13825,"jonNo, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
13826,manceHold! To me. To me.
13827,manceStand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
13828,stannisYou're the king beyond the wall?
13829,stannisYou know who I am?
13830,manceNever had the pleasure.
13831,"davosThis is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
13832,manceWe're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
13833,stannisIt is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
13834,manceWe do not kneel.
13835,"stannisI'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
13836,"manceAll the same, we do not kneel."
13837,stannisTake these men away.
13838,davosWhat are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
13839,jonI was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
13840,davosYou're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
13841,"jonI know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
13842,stannisYour father was an honorable man.
13843,"jonHe was, your grace."
13844,stannisWhat do you think he'd have done with him?
13845,"jonI was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
13846,stannisVery well. *to Davos* Take him.
13847,"jonYour grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
13848,pycelleI would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
13849,cerseiBloody Martells.
13850,pycelleThe cause appears to be manticore venom.
13851,"qyburnIt is, yes, manticore."
13852,"pycelleI've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
13853,qyburnYes there is.
13854,pycelleMay I ask what you think you're doing?
13855,qyburnSaving him.
13856,"pycelleYour grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
13857,qyburnThat's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
13858,"pycelleThat is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
13859,"cerseiYou're dismissed, Grand Maester."
13860,pycelleYour grace. This is my laboratory!
13861,cerseiNot anymore.
13862,cerseiYou can save him?
13863,"qyburnDifficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
13864,cerseiDo everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
13865,"qyburnThank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
13866,cerseiWill it weaken him?
13867,qyburnOh no.
13868,cerseiVery well then.
13869,"tywinNot another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
13870,cerseiI'm opening it again.
13871,tywinYou are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
13872,cerseiI will not.
13873,"tywinJaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
13874,"cerseiI don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
13875,"tywinWhen you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
13876,cerseiI'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
13877,tywinDo you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
13878,"cerseiWhen you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
13879,tywinNo.
13880,"cerseiJoffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
13881,tywinAnd how will you do that?
13882,cerseiI'll tell everyone the truth.
13883,tywinAnd what truth would that be?
13884,"cerseiYou don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
13885,tywinKnown what?
13886,cerseiEverything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
13887,"tywinNo, no, no, no, no."
13888,cerseiYour legacy is a lie.
13889,tywinI don't believe you.
13890,cerseiYes you do.
13891,cerseiJaime.
13892,"jaimeYou won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
13893,"cerseiFor my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
13894,jaimeTyrion is your family.
13895,cerseiHe's not.
13896,jaimeYou don't get to choose.
13897,"cerseiI do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
13898,jaimeAre you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
13899,"cerseiA disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
13900,"jaimeThe things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
13901,cerseiI choose you.
13902,jaimeThose are words.
13903,cerseiYes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
13904,jaimeTold him what?
13905,cerseiI told him about us.
13906,jaimeYou told him?
13907,"cerseiI told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
13908,jaimeYou think he'll just accept that?
13909,cerseiGo and ask him.
13910,jaimeWhat did you say?
13911,"cerseiI don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
13912,jaimeSomeone will walk in.
13913,cerseiI don't care.
13914,"missandeiin Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
13915,"fenneszin Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
13916,daenerysYou speak it very well.
13917,"fenneszBefore you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
13918,daenerysI hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
13919,"fenneszWhen you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
13920,daenerysI have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
13921,"fenneszI do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
13922,"daenerysMy Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
13923,"fenneszEven if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
13924,daenerysWhat is it that you want from me?
13925,"fenneszYour grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
13926,"daenerysYou want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
13927,"fenneszPlease, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
13928,daenerysI did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
13929,"fenneszThank you, your grace. Thank you."
13930,barristanThe masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
13931,daenerysApproach my friend.
13932,"manin Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen."
13933,missandeiin Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
13934,"mancrying, speaking Low Valyrian*"
13935,missandeitranslating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
13936,missandeitranslating* My girl. My little girl.
13937,daenerysWhat was her name?
13938,"missandeiZala, your grace."
13939,daenerysHow old was she?
13940,missandeiThree.
13941,daenerysThree. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
13942,"greyin Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
13943,daenerysin Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
13944,"aemonThey came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again."
13945,allAnd now their watch is ended.
13946,aemonAnd now their watch is ended.
13947,tormundYour old blind man patched me up. Why?
13948,"jonHe's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
13949,tormundYou want me alive so you can torture me?
13950,jonNo one's going to torture you.
13951,tormundSo how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
13952,jonI don't know what happens to the prisoners.
13953,tormundWho decides?
13954,jonI suppose Stannis does.
13955,tormundHe your king now?
13956,jonI don't have a king.
13957,"tormundYou spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again."
13958,jonWe're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
13959,tormundWords? What kind of words?
13960,jonFuneral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
13961,tormundDo what?
13962,jonSay farewell.
13963,"tormundThe dead can't hear us, boy."
13964,tormundSnow. Did you love her? She loved you.
13965,jonShe told you?
13966,tormundNo. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
13967,"meeraWe can stop, we can rest."
13968,jojenWe'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
13969,meeraWe're not going to make it.
13970,jojenWe're already here.
13971,"branJojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look."

13979,"girlHe is lost. Come with me, or die with him."
13980,jojenGo with them.
13981,girlThey cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.
13982,branWho are you?
13983,"girlThe First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you."
13984,branYou're the three-eyed raven.
13985,"oldI have been many things. Now, I am what you see."
13986,"meeraMy brother, he led us to you, and now he…"
13987,"oldHe knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway."
13988,meeraHow do you know?
13989,"oldI've been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."
13990,branI didn't want anyone to die for me.
13991,oldHe died so that you could find what you have lost.
13992,branYou're going to help me walk again?
13993,oldYou'll never walk again. But you will fly.
13994,briennePodrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
13995,podrickI hobbled them last night.
13996,brienneWhat sort of hobble?
13997,"podrickA figure-eight, like you taught me."
13998,brienneIf you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
13999,"podrickThieves, maybe?"
14000,brienneIt's at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddle bags.
14001,"aryaPeople coming. You can shit later, there's people coming!"
14002,brienneMorning!
14003,aryaMorning.
14004,brienneI like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
14005,aryaAbout ten more miles.
14006,brienneDid you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
14007,aryaAre you a knight?
14008,brienneNo.
14009,aryaBut you know how to use that sword.
14010,brienneI do.
14011,aryaDoes it have a name?
14012,brienneOathkeeper.”
14013,aryaMine's “Needle.”
14014,brienneGood name.
14015,aryaWho taught you how to fight?
14016,brienneMy father.
14017,aryaMine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
14018,"brienneMine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
14019,"brienneSeven blessings. I'm Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."
14020,sandorYou want something?
14021,podrickThat's Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
14022,brienneYou're Arya Stark.
14023,sandorI asked if you wanted something.
14024,brienneI swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
14025,aryaMy mother's dead.
14026,brienneI know. I wish I couldo ve been there to protect her.
14027,aryaYou're not a northerner.
14028,"brienneI know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
14029,aryaWhy didn't you?
14030,brienneShe commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
14031,sandorYou're paid by the Lannisters. You're here for the bounty on me.
14032,brienneI'm not paid by the Lannisters.
14033,"sandorNo? Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that's not Lannister gold."
14034,brienneJaime Lannister gave me this sword.
14035,aryaThe Bloody Gate's ten miles.
14036,brienneI swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
14037,aryaI don't care what you swore!
14038,brienneArya!
14039,sandorYou heard the girl! She's not coming with you.
14040,brienneShe is.
14041,sandorYou're not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I've always wanted some Valyrian steel.
14042,brienneCome with me Arya. I'll take you to safety.
14043,"sandorSafety?! Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie's dead. Her mother's dead, her father's dead, her brother's dead. Winterfell's a pile of rubble. There's no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her."
14044,brienneAnd that's what you're doing? Watching over her?
14045,"sandorAye, that's what I'm doing."
14046,brienneI have no wish to kill you Ser.
14047,sandorI'm not a knight.
14048,brienneArya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
14049,podrickShe was just here...
14050,brienneWhy weren't you watching her?
14051,podrickI was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
14052,brienneWhich way Pod? Which way did she go?
14053,"podrickAh, I think that way."
14054,sandorYou're still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
14055,aryaI don't need saving.
14056,"sandorNo, not you. You're a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle."
14057,aryaYou're gonna die?
14058,"sandorUnless there's a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done. I'd skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She'll help you. Going out alone, you won't last a day out there."
14059,aryaI'll last longer than you.
14060,"sandorYou remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I'm ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher's boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don't kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I shouldo ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I shouldo ve fucked her bloody. At least I'd have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it."
14061,sandorKill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
14062,"tyrionOh, get on with it you son of a whore."
14063,jaimeIs that any way to speak about our mother?
14064,tyrionWhat're you doing?
14065,jaimeWhat do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
14066,tyrionWho's helping you?
14067,jaimeVarys.
14068,tyrionVarys?
14069,jaimeYou have more friends than you thought.
14070,"jaimeThere's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
14071,"tyrionI suppose this is goodbye, then."
14072,"jaimeFarewell, little brother."
14073,"tyrionJaime, thank you. For my life."
14074,jaimeQuickly now.
14075,womanTywin… my lion...
14076,tyrionI'm sorry. I'm sorry.
14077,"tywinTyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
14078,"tyrionAll my life, you've wanted me dead."
14079,"tywinYes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son."
14080,tyrionI loved her.
14081,tywinWho?
14082,tyrionShae.
14083,"tywinBah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
14084,tyrionI murdered her. With my own hands.
14085,tywinIt doesn't matter.
14086,tyrionIt doesn't matter?
14087,tywinShe was a whore!
14088,tyrionSay that word again.
14089,tywinAnd what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense…
14090,"tyrionI am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
14091,tywinEnough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
14092,tyrionI can't go back there. She's in there.
14093,"tywinWhat, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
14094,tywinYou shot me. You're no son of mine.
14095,tyrionI am your son. I have always been your son.
14096,"varysWhat have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far."
14097,aryaI want to see the captain.
14098,captainYou're seeing him.
14099,"aryaI want to go north, to the wall."
14100,captainNo you don't.
14101,aryaI can pay.
14102,captainThere is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.
14103,"aryaI wouldn't need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
14104,"captainI'm not going north, child, we're going home."
14105,aryaWhere's home?
14106,captainThe Free City of Braavos.
14107,"aryaWait, I have something else."
14108,captainMore silver won't make a difference.
14109,"aryaIt's not silver, it's iron."
14110,aryaValar morghulis.
14111,"captainHow did you… valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin."
14112,melaraWe shouldn't be out here alone.
14113,cerseiWhy not?
14114,melaraIf your father hears…
14115,cerseiHe'll never know we've been gone.
14116,melaraBut if he finds out…
14117,cerseiYou don't need to be afraid of my father.
14118,melaraAre you sure?
14119,cerseiYes.
14120,melaraWe shouldn't go in.
14121,cerseiOf course we should.
14122,maggyGet out. Get out!
14123,melaraLet's go…
14124,cerseiNo.
14125,maggyListen to your friend.
14126,cerseiThey said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
14127,maggyYou don't know what I am.
14128,cerseiI know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14129,maggyEverybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14130,cerseiThis is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14131,maggyYour blood. Give me a taste.
14132,maggyThree questions you get. You won't like the answers.
14133,cerseiI've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14134,maggyYou'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
14135,cerseiBut I will be queen?
14136,"maggyOh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14137,cerseiWill the king and I have children?
14138,"maggyNo. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14139,cerseiThat doesn't make sense.
14140,maggyGold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14141,"melaraCome on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
14142,"priestYour grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
14143,cerseiThey will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14144,"priestBut your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
14145,priestFrom all seven kingdoms…
14146,cerseiThey will wait.
14147,"cerseiHe never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14148,"jaimeWhat he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
14149,cerseiThey?
14150,jaimeAll of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
14151,"cerseiThey had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
14152,jaimeThis is exactly what they want.
14153,cerseiand now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14154,"cerseiTyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14155,varysApologies.
14156,tyrionI still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14157,"varysI saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14158,tyrionDo you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14159,varysNo. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14160,tyrionPentos?
14161,"varysThe home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14162,tyrionMuch better.
14163,varysMy lord?
14164,tyrionI don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14165,varysYou already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14166,tyrionIn a box. Why stop now?
14167,varysBecause we are talking about the future of our country.
14168,tyrionThe future is shit. Just like the past.
14169,prostituteYou want the same? Same as always?
14170,whiteYou… you don't have to.
14171,prostituteHabit.
14172,daenerysSons of the Harpy?
14173,"barristanYes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14174,daenerysThey've never killed before.
14175,"barristanIt was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14176,daenerysI didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
14177,"mossadorThey do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14178,"daenerysThen they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14179,"greyWhite Rat, your grace."
14180,daenerysI want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14181,barristanThe Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14182,mossadorMake them very angry.
14183,daenerysAngry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14184,missandeiTorgo Nudho.
14185,greyMissandei hin Naath.
14186,missandeiI wanted to speak with you.
14187,greyWhy do you come?
14188,"missandeiWhite Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14189,greyI do not know. I must go.
14190,jonGet your shield up.
14191,ollyIt's too heavy.
14192,"jonIf it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
14193,jonCome. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
14194,"gillyShouldn't you be training, too?"
14195,"samWell, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14196,alliserThese men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
14197,alliserNot soldiers.
14198,gillyThat one hates me.
14199,samIf Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14200,samAll the wildlings.
14201,gillyDon't let them send us away.
14202,"samIt's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
14203,gillySam! Don't let them send us away.
14204,"samI told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
14205,"gillyYou can't leave, they'll execute you."
14206,"jonGood, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
14207,melisandreThe king wants a word.
14208,"jonYou're not cold, my lady?"
14209,"melisandreNever. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
14210,melisandreFeel.
14211,melisandreAre you a virgin?
14212,jonNo.
14213,melisandreGood.
14214,melisandreYour grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14215,stannisYou know who rules at Winterfell now?
14216,jonRoose Bolton.
14217,stannisThe traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
14218,"jonI want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
14219,davosI've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
14220,jonThey're good men.
14221,davosMany don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14222,jonIt's where she belonged.
14223,davosSome of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14224,jonThey were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
14225,stannisNo matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
14226,jonThe men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
14227,stannisI'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
14228,"jonYour grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14229,"stannisIf they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
14230,davosIt's a fair offer. More than fair.
14231,stannisI'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14232,jonI don't think that's likely.
14233,"stannisYou admire him, don't you?"
14234,jonI respect him.
14235,stannisHe likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14236,jonYour grace…
14237,stannisor he burns.
14238,jonHow much time do I have?
14239,"stannisNightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
14240,"masterSword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet!"
14241,yohnMy sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
14242,petyrLord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
14243,royceGreat warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
14244,squireMy lord.
14245,"masterSword up, my lord!"
14246,petyrSome boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
14247,royceHe's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14248,petyrHe has other gifts.
14249,royceDoes he?
14250,petyrThe gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
14251,"sansaGoodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
14252,"royceI have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
14253,"petyrI have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
14254,"royceHe'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
14255,"podrickWill we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
14256,brienneUs? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
14257,podrickBut I'm you're squire.
14258,brienneDo you even know what a squire is?
14259,podrickAn attendant to a knight?
14260,brienneI'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
14261,"podrickWell, where would I go?"
14262,"brienneI don't care, I'm not your mother."
14263,podrickYou swore to find the Stark girls.
14264,brienneI found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
14265,podrickSansa still might.
14266,brienneWill you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
14267,sansaYou told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
14268,petyrI did.
14269,sansaBut we're heading west.
14270,petyrWe are.
14271,"sansaIf he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
14272,"petyrLord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
14273,sansaNo. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
14274,"petyrNo. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
14275,sansaSo where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
14276,"petyrSo a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
14277,"lorasIt was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
14278,lorasBut just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
14279,cerseiThank you so much for your kind words.
14280,"grandDeepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
14281,lancelYour grace.
14282,cerseiCousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
14283,lancelMy deepest sympathies.
14284,kevanI apologize for my son's appearance.
14285,"cerseiUncle, it's quite alright."
14286,"kevanThey call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
14287,cerseiI'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
14288,kevanOf course.
14289,cerseiYour wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
14290,lancelIt wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
14291,cerseiWhat can I do for you?
14292,lancelYou can forgive me.
14293,cerseiWhat could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
14294,lancelI led you into the darkness.
14295,cerseiI doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
14296,"lancelI tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
14297,cerseiI don't know what you're talking about.
14298,"lancelI'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."
14299,cerseiThe day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
14300,olyvarIt looks like Dorne.
14301,lorasNo it doesn't.
14302,olyvarIt does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
14303,lorasSandstone.
14304,"olyvarYes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
14305,lorasFine.
14306,lorasIt's Dorne.
14307,olyvarWe should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
14308,"lorasJudging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
14309,margaeryWe're late for dinner as it is.
14310,lorasYou're very respectful.
14311,margaeryI'm very hungry.
14312,margaeryWhat's your name?
14313,"olyvarOlyvar, my lady."
14314,"margaeryI'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
14315,margaeryPerhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
14316,lorasWhy? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
14317,margaeryIn any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
14318,lorasMy intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
14319,margaeryLucky you.
14320,lorasUnlucky you.
14321,margaeryYou think I want that woman married to my brother?
14322,"lorasIf she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
14323,margaeryPerhaps.
14324,lorasPerhaps?
14325,margaeryPerhaps?
14326,"tyrionEunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
14327,"varysImp, half-man."
14328,varysThere are faster ways to kill yourself.
14329,tyrionNot for a coward.
14330,"varysYou are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
14331,tyrionYou never told me why you set me free.
14332,varysYour brother asked me to.
14333,tyrionYou could have said no.
14334,varysRefuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
14335,"tyrionNot as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
14336,varysI didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
14337,tyrionA drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
14338,varysI don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
14339,tyrionYou're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
14340,"varysYou have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
14341,tyrionI'm not well-suited for work.
14342,"varysI think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
14343,tyrionCompassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
14344,varysI never said you were perfect.
14345,tyrionWhat is it you want exactly?
14346,varysPeace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
14347,"tyrionWhere the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
14348,"varysPerhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
14349,tyrionI will never sit on the Iron Throne.
14350,"varysNo, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
14351,tyrionGood luck finding him.
14352,"varysWho said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
14353,tyrionCan I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
14354,daarioWhen did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
14355,"hizdahrThe mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
14356,daenerysGood.
14357,hizdahrThey did ask for some concessions.
14358,daenerysConcessions?
14359,"hizdahrPolitics is the art of compromise, your grace."
14360,daenerysI'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
14361,"hizdahrForgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
14362,"daenerysI don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
14363,hizdahrThey do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
14364,daenerysThe fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
14365,"hizdahrIn the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
14366,hizdahrThe pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
14367,daenerysNo fighting pits.
14368,hizdahrOpening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
14369,daenerysI do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
14370,hizdahrIf you--
14371,daenerysHow many times must I say no before you understand?
14372,daenerysWhatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
14373,daarioYou should reopen the fighting pits.
14374,daenerysWhat?
14375,"daarioMy mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
14376,daenerysWhy?
14377,"daarioI was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
14378,"daenerysYou were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
14379,"daarioI'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
14380,"daarioYou're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
14381,daenerysThat's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
14382,daarioAnyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
14383,daenerysI don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
14384,daarioA dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
14385,daenerysViserion? Rhaegal?
14386,daenerysEasy. Easy. Easy.
14387,manceSo here we are.
14388,jonHere we are.
14389,"manceWhen we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
14390,jonThis doesn't have to be our last meeting.
14391,"manceNo, but it will be."
14392,jonYou know what Stannis wants?
14393,manceHe wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
14394,jonShouldn't a king be bold?
14395,"manceOh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
14396,jonYou told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
14397,manceThat's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
14398,"jonYou spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
14399,mancePride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
14400,jonThen bend the knee and save your people.
14401,manceThey followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.
14402,jonAnd how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
14403,"manceOh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
14404,jonThey'll burn you alive.
14405,"manceBad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe."
14406,"jonAnd what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
14407,"manceYou're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
14408,jonI think you're making a terrible mistake.
14409,manceThe freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
14410,"stannisMance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
14411,stannisKneel and live.
14412,manceThis was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
14413,"melisandreMan or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
14414,"melisandreFree folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
14415,"braavosiIn the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies."
14416,aryaHe's just a statue.
14417,manDon't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.
14418,aryaI'm not afraid.
14419,manThe House of Black and White
14420,"manHere, I leave you."
14421,aryaThank you for bringing me.
14422,manAny man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
14423,aryaValar dohaeris.
14424,aryaHello. Valar Morghulis.
14425,aryaJaqen H'ghar gave me this.
14426,oldNo one here by that name.
14427,aryaPlease. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
14428,oldYou have everywhere else to go.
14429,aryaBut wait!
14430,"aryaCersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
14431,"aryaThe Mountain, Meryn Trant."
14432,podrickMust be good food if it's crowded.
14433,waitressAle? Ale?
14434,"sansaBefore we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
14435,petyrYou are becoming an observant young lady.
14436,"sansaMy mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
14437,petyrAn old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
14438,sansaSo it was good news.?
14439,petyrMy marriage proposal has been accepted.
14440,sansaI thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
14441,waitressAle?
14442,sansaI'll have some.
14443,podrickMy lady!
14444,brienneWhat is it?
14445,podrickSansa Stark. Don't look!
14446,brienneYou sure?
14447,"podrickShe's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
14448,brienneLittlefinger?
14449,podrickA bunch of knights with him.
14450,brienneBunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
14451,"podrick10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
14452,brienneReady the horses.
14453,podrickWe only have one horse.
14454,brienneFind more.
14455,petyrDo you like the taste?
14456,sansaI don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
14457,petyrIt gives some men courage.
14458,sansaDoes it give you courage?
14459,guardThat's far enough.
14460,"brienneLord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
14461,"petyrWe've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
14462,"brienneLady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
14463,"petyrPlease, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
14464,brienneI was.
14465,petyrStrange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
14466,brienneIt was after Renly's murder.
14467,"petyrAh, yes. You were accused of killing him."
14468,brienneI tried to save him.
14469,petyrBut you were accused.
14470,brienneBy men who didn't see what happened.
14471,petyrThen what did happen?
14472,brienneHe was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
14473,petyrA shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
14474,brienneWhy should you have any say in her affairs?
14475,"petyrBecause I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
14476,"brienneLady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
14477,sansaNo.
14478,"briennePlease, my lady. If I could explain--"
14479,sansaI saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
14480,brienneNeither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
14481,sansaAnd sometimes we do. You should leave.
14482,petyrWe don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
14483,knightHe asked you to stay.
14484,guardAfter her!
14485,briennePodrick!
14486,"podrickStop, stop, stop! That's a good boy."
14487,knightI guess that means you're unarmed.
14488,"brienneDown, Podrick, down!"
14489,briennePodrick?
14490,"podrickYes, my lady?"
14491,brienneYou can stand now.
14492,"podrickYes, my lady. Sansa Stark?"
14493,"brienneWary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
14494,"podrickMy lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow."
14495,brienneI swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.
14496,podrickIf they don't want your protection--
14497,brienneDo you think she's safe from Littlefinger?
14498,"podrickNo, my lady."
14499,brienneGet your horse.
14500,jaimeA summons from the queen.
14501,cerseiThere are only two like it in the world
14502,jaimeIt's a threat.
14503,"cerseiOf course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
14504,jaimeNo note.
14505,"cerseiThey blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
14506,jaimeSofter.
14507,cerseiWhat?
14508,jaimeNot so loud.
14509,"cerseiOur daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
14510,jaimeThe world can't know knows she's our daughter.
14511,cerseiThen don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
14512,"jaimeIf I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
14513,cerseiAnd what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
14514,jaimeI'll make things better.
14515,cerseiYou never made anything better.
14516,jaimeI'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
14517,cerseiYou can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
14518,jaimeI'm not going to ask him anything.
14519,"cerseiYou go there with an army, it's an act of war."
14520,jaimeNo army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
14521,cerseiOberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
14522,"jaimeI'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
14523,cerseiYou're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
14524,jaimeI never said I was going alone.
14525,"lollysNo sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
14526,lollysDon't they?
14527,bronnDon't who?
14528,lollysPeople eat pigeon pie in the capital.
14529,"bronnThey certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
14530,"bronnIt's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
14531,lollysYou won't.
14532,bronnPardon?
14533,"lollysWe won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
14534,bronnOh.
14535,"lollysShe hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
14536,bronnYou know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
14537,lollysShe is.
14538,"bronnI've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
14539,lollysWho's that?
14540,bronnJaime fucking Lannister.
14541,bronnSer Jaime.
14542,jaimeSer Bronn of the Blackwater.
14543,bronnI was very sorry to hear about your father.
14544,jaimeThank you.
14545,"bronnThis is my betrothed, Lollys."
14546,jaimeA pleasure.
14547,"bronnRun along, love."
14548,jaimeBeautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
14549,bronnJust get on with it.
14550,jaimeOn with what?
14551,bronnWhat you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
14552,jaimeIt's very good for you.
14553,bronnLollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
14554,jaimeMmm.
14555,"bronnWe made a deal, your sister and I."
14556,jaimeI would have advised against that.
14557,bronnHow is this good for me?
14558,"jaimeCause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
14559,bronnReturn from where?
14560,jaimeAs far south as south goes.
14561,trystaneMy future queen.
14562,areoThe prince does not wish to be disturbed.
14563,"ellariaRemove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
14564,doranCaptain. Let her pass.
14565,"ellariaYour brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
14566,"doranOberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
14567,ellariaYour brother--
14568,doranYou don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
14569,ellariaWhat will you do about his death.
14570,doranI will bury him. I will mourn for him.
14571,ellariaYou would have me go to war?
14572,doranYou would have me go to war?
14573,ellariaThe whole country would have you go to war.
14574,doranThen we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
14575,ellariaThe Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
14576,"ellariaOberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
14577,doranI loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
14578,ellariaAnd how long will that be?
14579,daarioThe Unsullied are too conspicuous.
14580,"daarioAnyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
14581,"daarioMy Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
14582,greyNo one here. We go.
14583,daarioIn a hurry? You're afraid?
14584,greyUnsullied fear nothing.
14585,"daarioRight. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
14586,daarioFear is useful that way.
14587,"mossadorSons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
14588,daenerysIt would send a message.
14589,"barristanI think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
14590,daenerysWhy?
14591,"barristanFor one thing, he may have valuable information."
14592,daarioThe Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
14593,barristanHow do you know that?
14594,daarioBecause I questioned him.
14595,"hizdahrAnd the information you did get, he is young and poor."
14596,mossadorHe is born free.
14597,hizdahrWhy should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
14598,daenerysPerhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
14599,mossadorThey pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
14600,hizdahrAnd how do you know this?
14601,mossadorEveryone knows this.
14602,"hizdahrI don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
14603,"barristanWe do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
14604,"mossadorI do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
14605,daenerysThank you all for your counsel.
14606,"barristanYour Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
14607,daenerysAbout what?
14608,barristanAbout your father. About the Mad King.
14609,daenerysThe Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
14610,"barristanYour Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
14611,daenerysGo on.
14612,"barristanWhen the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
14613,daenerysI'm not my father.
14614,"barristanNo, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
14615,daenerysI will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
14616,barristanYour Grace.
14617,tyrionThere's a bug.
14618,"varysYes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
14619,"tyrionWhen I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
14620,varysYou don't like it?
14621,tyrionI want to take a walk.
14622,varysYou can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
14623,"tyrionShe ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
14624,varysAre we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
14625,tyrionYou're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
14626,varysThe road to Meereen.
14627,tyrionAnd what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
14628,varysI told you. A ruler.
14629,tyrionWe've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
14630,"varysYou were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
14631,tyrionI didn't rule. I was a servant.
14632,"varysStill, a man of talent."
14633,tyrionManaged to kill a lot of people.
14634,"varysYes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
14635,tyrionShe wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
14636,varysWhy?
14637,tyrionCause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
14638,varysPeople follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
14639,tyrionI find us repulsive.
14640,"varysAnd we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
14641,tyrionYou're right. Let's go for a walk.
14642,varysNo.
14643,tyrionHow many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
14644,cerseiNot him.
14645,"merynAre you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
14646,"cerseiThat won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
14647,"huntersThank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
14648,cerseiTake the head.
14649,"qyburnPardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
14650,cerseiVery good.
14651,qyburnOver there will be fine.
14652,merynYou heard the man. Over there.
14653,kevanYou're the Hand of the King?
14654,"cerseiNo, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
14655,"maceYour Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
14656,"cerseiYou're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
14657,"maceOh, Your Grace."
14658,cerseiHe called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
14659,"maceThe honor is all mine, Your Grace."
14660,"pycelleYour Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
14661,cerseiThe King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
14662,"pycelleYour Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
14663,"cerseiThe qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
14664,pycelleI must say I cannot see--
14665,"cerseiUncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
14666,kevanThat is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
14667,cerseiThe king is very busy at this moment.
14668,"kevanHe should be here, learning what it means to rule."
14669,"cerseiHe is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
14670,kevanI returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
14671,cerseiMy brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
14672,kevanWhat mission?
14673,cerseiThat is not your concern as Master of War.
14674,kevanI do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
14675,cerseiYou would abandon your king in his time of need?
14676,"kevanIf he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
14677,shireenCome on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
14678,gillySnake. Snake... S! It's an S!
14679,"shireenRight, very good!"
14680,"samHmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
14681,"gillyI know ""S""."
14682,"shireenYou'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
14683,"gillyWell, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!"
14684,"samI only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
14685,gillyThat's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
14686,gillyHow old were you when you learned to read?
14687,shireenThree.
14688,"samThree?! Who taught you, your mother?"
14689,shireenNo. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
14690,"gillyWhat do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
14691,shireenGreyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
14692,gillyI don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
14693,"shireenI don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
14694,gillyMy father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
14695,samDid you ever see them?
14696,"gillyOnly once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
14697,shireenWhat did he do to them in the woods?
14698,shireenMother.
14699,selyseLeave us.
14700,samYour Grace.
14701,selyseYou need to stay away from that girl.
14702,shireenWhy?
14703,selyseShe's a wildling.
14704,shireenHer name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
14705,selyseShe's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
14706,shireenGilly wouldn't do that.
14707,selyseYou have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
14708,"stannisI ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
14709,"jonWith respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
14710,stannisWho then? You?
14711,jonNo. Only one of their own.
14712,stannisDo you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
14713,jonThe Lord Commander's niece.
14714,"stannisLady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
14715,"jonBear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
14716,stannisThat amuses you?
14717,"jonI apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
14718,stannisI know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
14719,"davosTonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
14720,jonMost likely.
14721,davosUnpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
14722,"jonUnpleasant, I expect."
14723,stannisYour bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
14724,"jonI don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
14725,stannisYou can give me the North.
14726,"jonI can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
14727,"stannisKneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
14728,samHe'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
14729,"jonIt's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
14730,samYou deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
14731,jonI'm going to refuse him.
14732,samBut you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
14733,"jonI swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
14734,alliserCrowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
14735,aemonDoes anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
14736,"janosSer Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
14737,"menHear, hear."
14738,janosHe's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
14739,aemonIs there anyone else?
14740,"shadowSer Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
14741,"aemonIf there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
14742,samMaester Aemon.
14743,aemonSamwell Tarly. Go on.
14744,janosSam the Slayer.
14745,janosAnother wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
14746,samHer name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
14747,janosLies!
14748,"samA wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
14749,"samWhilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
14750,"samSer Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
14751,"alliserI can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
14752,aemonIt is time.
14753,"brotherIt appears to be a tie, Maester."
14754,brothersJon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

14767,jaqenNo one. And that is who a girl must become.
14768,"harpyShe doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
14769,"mossadorFor you, Mhysa. You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
14770,"daenerysHe was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
14771,mossadorHe would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
14772,daenerysThere are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
14773,"mossadorThen who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
14774,"daenerysThe Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
14775,mosadorand now you are the law!
14776,daenerysThe law is the law. Take him.
14777,crowdMhysa! Myhsa!
14778,hizdahrShe should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
14779,daarioWhich is what I keep telling her to do to you.

14808,margaeryNo. You were lovely.

14810,margaeryYes. .
14811,"tommenI was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
14812,"margaeryNo, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
14813,"tommenThis is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
14814,"margaeryWouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
14815,tommenOf course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
14816,"margaeryNo, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
14817,tommenKing Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
14818,margaerySo strange… Husband.
14819,"tommenWife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died."
14820,"margaeryI understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
14821,tommenI don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
14822,tommenDo you like to sail?
14823,margaeryI love to sail.

14827,tommenI don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
14828,margaeryIt's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
14829,"tommenWell, but I'm a man now."
14830,margaeryYou are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
14831,tommenI suppose.
14832,"margaeryI adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
14833,"cerseiYou look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."

14835,cerseiThere's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
14836,tommenThat's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
14837,cerseiWhy are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
14838,"tommenThe way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."

14843,"margaeryI said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
14844,margaeryMother! . Welcome.
14845,cerseiDon't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
14846,margaeryCan we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
14847,"cerseiNo, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
14848,margaeryYou are very sweet.
14849,cerseiTommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
14850,margaeryI absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
14851,cerseiGood. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
14852,"margaeryEcstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. ."
14853,cerseiI'll leave you to it then. .
14854,"margaeryOh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
14855,cerseiThere's no need for such formalities.
14856,"margaeryIn any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
14857,cerseiWon't that be a lovely day.
14858,margaeryCan you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
14859,cerseiRemember. Anything you need.
14860,rooseWe can't hold the North with terror alone.
14861,ramsayYou can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
14862,"rooseI sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
14863,"ramsayLord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
14864,rooseHe left you no choice.
14865,"ramsayI flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
14866,rooseAnd?
14867,ramsayThe new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
14868,rooseI have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
14869,rooseWe don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
14870,ramsayOur pact with the Lannisters protects -
14871,"rooseI had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
14872,sansaThat's Moat Cailin.
14873,"petyrYes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
14874,"sansaOn our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
14875,petyrHome.
14876,"sansaThe Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
14877,petyrNo.
14878,sansaRoose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
14879,petyrHe did.
14880,sansaHe serves the Lannisters.
14881,petyrFor now.
14882,sansaI won't go.
14883,petyrWinterfell is your home.
14884,sansaNot anymore.
14885,petyrAlways. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
14886,sansaI can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
14887,"petyrYou're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
14888,sansaNo!
14889,petyrSansa -
14890,"sansaNo, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
14891,"petyrI won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
14892,podrickHow do we get through there?
14893,brienneWe don't. We go around. .
14894,podrickIt sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
14895,brienneDoesn't matter. I know where they're going.
14896,brienneAren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
14897,podrickHe hates that nickname.
14898,"brienneWell, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
14899,"podrickI squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
14900,brienneHe borrowed it?
14901,"podrickHe wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
14902,brienneAs punishment. For both of you.
14903,podrickIt didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
14904,"brienneYes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
14905,podrickI'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
14906,brienneI'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
14907,podrickIf you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
14908,"brienneYou want to be a knight, Pod?"
14909,podrickYes.
14910,"brienneStarting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
14911,podrickThank you.
14912,"brienneI can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
14913,podrickI suppose that's more important.
14914,"podrickYou weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
14915,brienneI was.
14916,podrickLord Tyrion said he was a good man.
14917,brienneHe was.
14918,podrickBut how did you end up serving Renly?
14919,"brienneWhen I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
14920,podrickBut wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
14921,"brienneYes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
14922,podrickBut you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
14923,"brienneA shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
14924,stannisLord Commander.
14925,jonYour Grace.
14926,stannisI'd like to speak alone.
14927,"jonOlly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
14928,stannisVery well. . Have you considered my offer?
14929,jonI have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
14930,stannisSay the word and you will be.
14931,jonBut I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
14932,stannisI'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
14933,"jonI wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
14934,stannisYou're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
14935,jonI can imagine no higher praise.
14936,"stannisI didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
14937,"jonMay I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
14938,stannisAre you bored of us already?
14939,jonYou saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
14940,stannisI know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
14941,jonAnd the wildlings?
14942,"stannisThey'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
14943,"jonMost of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
14944,stannisYou're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
14945,stannisYou have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
14946,jonI heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
14947,stannisWhoever said that didn't have many enemies.
14948,"davosHe sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
14949,jonI'm sorry I disappointed him.
14950,davosThe king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
14951,jonAs long as he's ruling them.
14952,davosHe's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
14953,jonI've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
14954,davosHave you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
14955,ollyNight gathers and now my watch begins -
14956,"davosNot that bit, the bit at the end."
14957,"ollyI'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
14958,"davosWait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
14959,jonAnd what needs to be done?
14960,"davosAs long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
14961,aryaWhat do you want?
14962,waifWho are you?
14963,aryaWhat?
14964,"waifYou, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?"
14965,aryaNo one.
14966,aryaOw! Cunt!
14967,"waifA lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
14968,"aryaI told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
14969,aryaYou're about to find out.
14970,jaqenWhat are you doing?
14971,waifWe were only playing. The game of faces.
14972,jaqenA girl is not ready.
14973,waifClearly not.
14974,aryaI am ready.
14975,jaqenFor what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
14976,"jaqenWhose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
14977,aryaWhat do we do with them after we wash them?
14978,manOpen gates!
14979,"rooseLady Sansa, welcome."
14980,sansaLord Bolton.
14981,"rooseMay I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?"
14982,"ramsayIt's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
14983,womanI'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
14984,sansaThank you.
14985,"womanWelcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers."
14986,jonSam. . Maester Aemon?
14987,samHe apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
14988,"jonTake good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
14989,"jonSer Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
14990,jonLord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
14991,janosGreyguard is a ruin.
14992,"jonYes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
14993,janosI was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
14994,"samAlright, alright! Enough of that."
14995,"jonYou mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
14996,"janosI will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
14997,jonAre you refusing to obey my order?
14998,janosYou can stick your order up your bastard arse.
14999,jonTake Lord Janos outside.
15000,"jonOlly, bring me my sword."
15001,"janosYou cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
15002,"janosA disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
15003,"jonIf you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
15004,"janosI was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
15005,"olyvarYou have served us well, my son."
15006,"septonThank you, Father."
15007,olyvarWhich of the Seven will you worship today?
15008,septonThe Maiden.
15009,olyvarWhere is the Maiden?
15010,septonAnd the Stranger.
15011,"olyvarTwo is extra, you realize?"
15012,"septonYes, yes."
15013,olyvarWhat are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
15014,lancelYou have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
15015,septonI am the High Septon of the -
15016,lancelYou are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
15017,crowdSinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15018,manRepent!
15019,crowdSinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15020,manShame on you!
15021,crowdSinner! Sinner!
15022,"septonYour Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…"
15023,qyburnIt doesn't matter. .
15024,"septonAs the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
15025,cerseiYou were assaulted?
15026,"septonI was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
15027,qyburnI heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
15028,"maceHigh Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
15029,"septonI tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
15030,qyburnSo you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
15031,pycelleA man's private affairs ought to stay private!
15032,"cerseiWhat do you want from us, High Septon?"
15033,"septonJustice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
15034,cerseiAnd where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
15035,"merynI don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
15036,"cerseiNonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
15037,manSeven blessings.
15038,manThank you.
15039,manJust a little more...
15040,womanThank you ever so for the soup!
15041,cerseiA young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
15042,"sparrowHigh Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
15043,womanSeven blessings to you.
15044,"sparrowSeven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. ."
15045,cerseiWhy no shoes?
15046,sparrowBecause I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15047,cerseiIs that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
15048,"sparrowEveryone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
15049,cerseiPerhaps they're right.
15050,"sparrowIt would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15051,"cerseiAn unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
15052,"sparrowHypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
15053,"cerseiThe High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
15054,sparrowI wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
15055,"cerseiMy thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
15056,qyburnYour Grace.
15057,"cerseiSend a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
15058,"qyburnAt once, Your Grace. ."
15059,cerseiHow's your work coming along?
15060,qyburnVery well.
15061,cerseiYou've made progress?
15062,"qyburnMore than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
15063,"cerseiVery good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
15064,"qyburnShh. Easy, friend."
15065,ramsayShe really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
15066,petyrI hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
15067,ramsayI'll never hurt her. You have my word.
15068,"petyrI've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
15069,ramsayI haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
15070,rooseAnd you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
15071,"ramsayYes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. ."
15072,petyrHe seems pleased.
15073,rooseShouldn't he be?
15074,"petyrI assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
15075,"rooseI leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
15076,petyrThen I have delivered everything I've promised.
15077,rooseAnd you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15078,"petyrThe Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15079,rooseThe Queen will be enraged.
15080,"petyrQueen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
15081,"rooseAnd yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
15082,"petyrA message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
15083,"rooseI'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15084,petyrEvery ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
15085,rooseI had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
15086,"petyrThe Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
15087,rooseI'd like to read the reply.
15088,tyrionI have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15089,varysVolantis is a large city.
15090,varysThe likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
15091,"tyrionMm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
15092,varysI'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
15093,tyrionI will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
15094,varysIt's a perfectly good face.
15095,tyrionI'm losing my mind.
15096,"varysIf anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
15097,"tyrionLook, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
15098,tyrionSlaves.
15099,varysYes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.

15107,tyrionThe only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
15108,priestessThe Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
15109,tyrionStone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
15110,priestessHe has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
15111,tyrionWe're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
15112,tyrionCome on. Let's find a brothel.
15113,manIt's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.
15114,tyrionIt's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
15115,"tyrionSee? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
15116,varysThank you.
15117,tyrionCurious... hair. .
15118,manThe mother of dragons!
15119,tyrionIt appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
15120,varysSomeone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
15121,manWhat makes you worth that much?
15122,blondeI'm magic. .
15123,manI bet you bloody are.
15124,"tyrionWell, , she's taken."
15125,varysWhere're you going?
15126,tyrionI need to speak to someone with hair.
15127,tyrionHello?
15128,blackHello.
15129,tyrionYou've got no drink.
15130,blackYou've got no money.
15131,"tyrionDo I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
15132,blackYou like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
15133,tyrionThat's because they've never met a queen.
15134,blackYou're just saying that.
15135,"tyrionYou know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
15136,blackWhy?
15137,tyrionBecause you have a skeptical mind.
15138,"blackAlright, then. I'm warning you. We're gonna have to wash you first."
15139,blackCome on.
15140,"tyrionI'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
15141,blackOf course you can. You're shy.
15142,tyrionI'm not.
15143,blackHave another drink.
15144,"tyrionGladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start."
15145,"tyrionNo need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
15146,tyrionYou made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
15147,jorahI'm taking you to the Queen.

15149,jaimeIs that Estermont?
15150,"captainTarth, Ser Jaime. . The Sapphire Isle."
15151,bronnWhy are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
15152,"jaimeThis ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
15153,bronnYou ever been to Dorne?
15154,jaimeNo.
15155,bronnI have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
15156,jaimeYou should be happy to go back. .
15157,"bronnThere's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
15158,"jaimeWe are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
15159,bronnYour niece?
15160,bronnI've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .
15161,jaimeThat's why you're here.
15162,"bronnI know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
15163,jaimeBecause I don't want to start a war.
15164,bronnThat still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
15165,jaimeIt has to be me.

15168,jaimeVarys set him free.

15170,"jaimeHe murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."

15173,"maceWith winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
15174,cerseiYou're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
15175,"maceWell, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
15176,"cerseiYou've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
15177,maceAbsolutely.
15178,cerseiIn person.
15179,maceMe? .
15180,"cerseiWe must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."

15187,cerseiNot small enough.
15188,"cerseiMay I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
15189,sparrowNo. .
15190,cerseiThe old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .
15191,"sparrowI could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, , I don't like the taste."
15192,cerseiHmm.
15193,sparrowHow may I serve?
15194,cerseiAll over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
15195,"sparrowWars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
15196,"cerseiPerhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
15197,"sparrowWell, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
15198,"cerseiIf I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
15199,sparrowAn army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
15200,"cerseiAn army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
15201,"sparrowAn honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
15202,"cerseiWhich is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
15203,sparrowAll sinners are equal before the Gods.
15204,cerseiWhat would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
15205,sparrowMay the Father judge him justly. .

15217,"tommenI, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
15218,margaeryWe both know who did. . You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
15219,tommenAre you saying my mother is behind this?
15220,margaeryShe's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
15221,tommenAren't you and mother getting along?
15222,"margaeryOh, my sweet, sweet King. . Do you have any affection for me at all?"
15223,tommenOf course I do. You're my Queen.
15224,margaeryI can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
15225,tommenI'll set him free for you.
15226,margaeryDo you promise?
15227,tommenI demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
15228,cerseiDid I arrest him?
15229,"tommenWell, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
15230,"cerseiI did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
15231,tommenThen can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
15232,"cerseiI told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
15233,kingsguardHalt!
15234,militantHis Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.
15235,kingsguardGive the order and we'll tear out this rebel.
15236,"tommenYou mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?"
15237,kingsguardYou'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.

15245,tommenThere was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
15246,"margaeryYou're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law."
15247,tommenI'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.

15249,tommenI--I don't know.
15250,margaeryYou don't know?
15251,tommenHe was praying just now.

15258,stannisLord Commander of the Night's Watch.
15259,selyseA bastard by some tavern slut.
15260,"stannisPerhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
15261,selyseI should have given you a son.
15262,stannisNot your fault.
15263,selyseWhose then? . I gave you nothing but weakness. . And deformity. .
15264,melisandreThose scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
15265,selyseMy Lady.
15266,melisandreHer father is the Lordo s chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
15267,melisandreYou march on Winterfell soon?
15268,stannisWe must. To beat the snows.
15269,melisandreOnce before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
15270,stannisI won't. I need you.
15271,"melisandreYou only need faith, my King."
15272,"stannisAnd you, my Lady, what do you need?"
15273,melisandreTo serve my Lord.
15274,samLord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.
15275,jonNever even heard of these people.
15276,samThey haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.
15277,jonAnd how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
15278,samMore than Lord Wibberley.
15279,jonNot him.
15280,"samI know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
15281,jonHe murdered my brother.
15282,samWe swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
15283,"samApologies, my Lady."
15284,melisandreLord Commander.
15285,jonHow can I help you?
15286,"melisandreCome with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? ."
15287,jonCastle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
15288,melisandreThere's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .
15289,"jonYou're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
15290,melisandreNo visions. No magic. Just life.
15291,"melisandreDo you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
15292,"melisandreThe Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
15293,jonI don't think Stannis would like that very much.
15294,melisandreThen we shouldn't tell him. .
15295,jonI can't.
15296,melisandreWhy?
15297,jonI swore a vow. . I loved another.
15298,melisandreThe dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
15299,jonI know. But I still love her.
15300,"melisandreYou know nothing, Jon Snow."
15301,stannisAre you lonely?
15302,shireenJust bored.
15303,stannisMy father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
15304,"shireenWere you bored a lot, too?"
15305,"stannisI know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
15306,shireenI like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .
15307,stannisWhy do you say that?
15308,"shireenShe told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
15309,stannisShe shouldn't have said that.
15310,"shireenAre you ashamed of me, father?"
15311,"stannisWhen you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
15312,petyrI thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
15313,"sansaFather never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
15314,"petyrI saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
15315,"sansaYes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
15316,petyrCome. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
15317,sansaDressed for riding?
15318,petyrI am.
15319,sansaWhere are you going?
15320,petyrKing's Landing.
15321,sansaKing's Landing?
15322,petyrCersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
15323,sansaYou can't leave me here!
15324,"petyrI know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
15325,sansaHow do you know?
15326,"petyrStannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
15327,sansaYou don't know that.
15328,"petyrI do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
15329,sansaYou think he'll defeat the Boltons?
15330,"petyrHe has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
15331,sansaAnd if you're right?
15332,"petyrStannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
15333,"sansaBut I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
15334,petyrYou are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
15335,"sansaWhat if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
15336,"petyrThen you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
15337,sansaI don't know how to do that.
15338,petyrOf course you do. He's already fallen for you.
15339,sansaHis father frightens me.
15340,"petyrHe should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
15341,sansaI expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
15342,bronnBreakfast.
15343,bronnThat would have been a shit way to die.
15344,"jaimeAs far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
15345,bronnAye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
15346,jaimeI don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
15347,"bronnNo? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
15348,jaimeSounds like all the rest.
15349,jaimeWhat about you? What shit way would you choose?
15350,"bronnIn my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
15351,jaimeHow disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
15352,bronnI've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
15353,jaimeIn the arms of the woman I love.
15354,bronnShe want the same thing?
15355,jaimeLet's go.
15356,"bronnThe captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
15357,jaimePentoshi.
15358,bronnAnd he's headed to Oldtown?
15359,jaimeAs I said. Why?
15360,bronnWhat's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
15361,jaimeA bag of gold.
15362,bronnI'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
15363,jaimeIt was a heavy bag.
15364,bronnAnd I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
15365,bronnHow many you count?
15366,jaimeFour.
15367,bronnHow many you think you can take?
15368,"jaimeOne, if he's slow."
15369,riderHalt!
15370,"bronnFucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
15371,riderWho are you?
15372,bronnCooper. . This is Darnell.
15373,riderYou're from King's Landing.
15374,bronnAccent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
15375,riderWhy are you here?
15376,"bronnOur ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
15377,jaimeI thought the sharks would get us. .
15378,riderThere are no sharks in Dorne.
15379,jaimeI could have sworn those were shark fins.
15380,bronnDolphins maybe.
15381,riderThrow your swords in the sand.
15382,"bronnBoys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
15383,riderSwords in the sand! Now!
15384,bronnThat one should be slow enough.
15385,bronnNice move! .
15386,jaimeLuck.
15387,bronnYou had a wonderful teacher.
15388,bronnAlways wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
15389,jaimeFirst we need to bury these bodies.
15390,bronnBirds have to eat too.
15391,"jaimeCorpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
15392,bronnDo you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
15393,"jaimeI can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
15394,tyeneNama!
15395,"elariaNym, Obara."
15396,obaraWill it be war?
15397,"elariaPrince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
15398,obaraWithout Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
15399,"elariaWe don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
15400,nymeriaWe may have a problem.
15401,"obaraA ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
15402,"elariaHe's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
15403,tyeneI'm with you. Always. .
15404,elariaNym? . Obara?
15405,"obaraWhen I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
15406,obaraI made my choice long ago.
15407,tyrionThank you. . Who are you?
15408,jorahYour captor.
15409,tyrionDo you have wine?
15410,jorahNo.
15411,tyrionI can't sleep without wine.
15412,jorahThen stay awake.
15413,tyrionYou're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
15414,jorahI'm not taking you to your sister.
15415,tyrionYou said you were taking me to the Queen.
15416,jorahI am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
15417,tyrionWhat a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
15418,jorahWhat business would you have with the Queen?
15419,"tyrionGold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
15420,daenerysEveryone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
15421,"barristanI was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
15422,daenerysWhy?
15423,"barristanHe liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
15424,daenerysHe sang to them?
15425,barristanYes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
15426,daenerysAnd what did you do?
15427,barristanI made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
15428,daenerysHe was good?
15429,barristanHe was very good. Viserys never told you?
15430,daenerysHe told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
15431,barristanRhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
15432,daenerysAnd what did you do with the money?
15433,"barristanWell, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. ."
15434,"daarioYour Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
15435,daenerysHow many others are there?
15436,daarioFifty a hundred.
15437,"daenerysWill you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
15438,daarioI think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
15439,"daenerysI think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
15440,barristanYour Grace. .
15441,hizdahrAll men must die. But not all can die in glory.
15442,missandeiGlory?
15443,"hizdahrWhy else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
15444,daenerysIs that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
15445,"hizdahrYour Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
15446,daenerysI do not recognize this tradition.
15447,"hizdahrTraditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. . Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."
15448,womanSons of the Harpy.
15449,endEPISODE
15450,"hizdahrI am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
15451,"daenerysBarristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
15452,"daarioWe could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
15453,daenerysI prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
15454,hizdahrBut... I'm the leader of my family.
15455,"hizdahrNo, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
15456,daenerysWalk forward.
15457,manYou cannot do this.
15458,daenerysAnother step.
15459,"daenerysThey will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
15460,daenerysBut she does not give up on them.
15461,"daenerysWho is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
15462,hizdahrAll men must die.
15463,daenerysDon't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
15464,"samAnd though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
15465,"aemonAnd she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
15466,"samDon't say that, Maester Aemon."
15467,"aemonA Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
15468,jonMaester Aemon.
15469,aemonLord Commander.
15470,"jonSam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
15471,jonHow are you feeling?
15472,"aemonOh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
15473,"jonI need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
15474,"aemonHalf the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
15475,jonBut you don't know what it is.
15476,"aemonThat doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
15477,jonWhere are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
15478,tormundThey followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
15479,jonWhat about you?
15480,tormundHard to lead when you're in chains.
15481,jonWhat if I unchained you?
15482,tormundWhy would you do that?
15483,jonBecause you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
15484,tormundYou sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
15485,"jonFor 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
15486,tormundAnd now everything is going to change?
15487,jonIt is.
15488,tormundWhy now?
15489,"jonBecause now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
15490,"tormundWhat would you have me do, , Lord Commander?"
15491,jonI'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
15492,tormundThey won't kneel for you and neither will I.
15493,jonI don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
15494,tormundThe day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
15495,"jonAnd how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
15496,tormundEasy thing to say to a man in chains.
15497,jonYour people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
15498,tormundMost of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
15499,jonUp on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
15500,tormundWe'll need ships.
15501,jonI'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
15502,"tormundAll right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
15503,"manYou'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
15504,"jonMen, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
15505,manLet them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
15506,stannisFewer.
15507,davosWhat?
15508,stannisNothing.
15509,samThere is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
15510,manAnd why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
15511,allisterWe've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
15512,jonAnd we've slaughtered theirs.
15513,"eddI will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
15514,"jonYou were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
15515,"jonThank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
15516,"ollyYou don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
15517,jonIt's not a trick.
15518,"ollyThey burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
15519,jonI know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
15520,"ollyWill there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
15521,jonNo.
15522,podrickShe's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
15523,brienneBetter off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
15524,brienneThank you. You've lived here a long time?
15525,manAye.
15526,brienneDid you know Lord Eddard?
15527,manI knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
15528,brienneNot all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
15529,manEveryone knows. The Boltons.
15530,brienneI'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
15531,manWho are you?
15532,brienneSomeone who swore to keep her safe.
15533,manSwore to who?
15534,brienneHer mother.
15535,manHer mother's dead.
15536,brienneThat doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
15537,ramsayCome back here. Myranda.
15538,myrandaI saw you staring at her.
15539,ramsayI'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
15540,myrandaYou said you'd marry me.
15541,ramsayAnd I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
15542,myrandaDo you think she's pretty?
15543,ramsayOf course I do. I'm not blind.
15544,"ramsayYou think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
15545,"myrandaPerhaps I'll marry, too."
15546,"ramsayYou're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
15547,myrandaNever.
15548,"womanBeg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
15549,"sansaOh, I don't need-"
15550,"womanYou still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
15551,sansaBut who -
15552,womanYou're not alone.
15553,myrandaI like your dress. Who made it for you?
15554,sansaI made it myself.
15555,myrandaReally?
15556,"sansaWho, who are you?"
15557,"myrandaI'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
15558,sansaMy mother. .
15559,myrandaI'm sorry for what happened to her.
15560,sansaThank you.
15561,"myrandaIt's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
15562,sansaI'd rather have a mother.
15563,"myrandaI know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
15564,myrandaDown there at the end.
15565,sansaWhat is it?
15566,"myrandaThat would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
15567,sansaTheon?
15568,theonYou shouldn't be here.
15569,ramsayYou smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
15570,ramsayDo you have something to tell me?
15571,"theonNo, my lord."
15572,ramsayReek.
15573,theonShe saw me.
15574,ramsayWho?
15575,theonSansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
15576,ramsayShe saw you?
15577,"theonYes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
15578,ramsayCome here.
15579,"ramsayYou mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
15580,ramsayGive me your hand.
15581,ramsayI forgive you.
15582,"rooseI trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
15583,"sansaYes, thank you, my lord."
15584,ramsayAllow me.
15585,ramsayMother.
15586,"waldaThank you, Ramsay."
15587,"ramsayMy lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
15588,rooseTo your wedding.
15589,waldaTo your wedding.
15590,waldaIt must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
15591,sansaThis isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
15592,"ramsayYou're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
15593,"ramsayI heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
15594,"theonYes, master."
15595,"ramsayThat's his new name, Reek."
15596,sansaWhy are you doing this?
15597,"ramsayBecause Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
15598,theonI'm sorry.
15599,"ramsayLook at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
15600,ramsaySorry about what?
15601,theonFor killing your brothers.
15602,"ramsayThere, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
15603,"rooseYes, yes, very good."
15604,ramsayWonderful. .
15605,"rooseWalda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
15606,waldaWe're going to have a baby.
15607,sansaI'm very happy for you.
15608,"rooseFrom the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
15609,ramsayHow can you be sure?
15610,rooseSure of what?
15611,ramsayThat she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
15612,rooseMaester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
15613,ramsaySo how did you manage it?
15614,rooseManage what?
15615,ramsayGetting her pregnant.
15616,rooseI imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
15617,"ramsayOf course, but how did you find it?"
15618,"rooseYou disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
15619,ramsayAnd if it's a boy?
15620,rooseYou're worried about your position.
15621,ramsayMy position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
15622,rooseYou've never asked me about your mother.
15623,"ramsayWhy would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
15624,"rooseShe was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
15625,ramsayYes.
15626,gillyIs this every book there is?
15627,samEvery book there is?
15628,gillyIn the world.
15629,"samWell, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
15630,"gillyWhere you grew up, were there more books?"
15631,samMy father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
15632,gillyWhere's that?
15633,samThe Citadel? In Oldtown.
15634,gillyI'm sorry I don't know things.
15635,"samGilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
15636,gillyI can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
15637,samWell -
15638,gillyWhy does the Citadel have the biggest library?
15639,samIt's where they train the maesters.
15640,gillyLike Maester Aemon?
15641,"samI wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
15642,"samAh, Your Grace."
15643,stannisYou're Samwell Tarly?
15644,"samI am, Your Grace."
15645,"stannisYour father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
15646,"samI did, Your Grace."
15647,stannisHow?
15648,samWith a dagger made of dragonglass.
15649,stannisDragonglass?
15650,samWhat the maesters call obsidian -
15651,stannisI know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
15652,"samI don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
15653,stannisThe Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
15654,"samI've seen it, Your Grace."
15655,stannisSeen what?
15656,samThe army of the dead. And when they come -
15657,"stannisWe have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
15658,stannisIt's time.
15659,"davosUh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
15660,"stannisIf Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
15661,davosI'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
15662,"stannisNo need, they're coming with us."
15663,"davosIt's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
15664,"stannisHere? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
15665,"davosAs you wish, Your Grace."
15666,shireenDo you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
15667,davosBeg your pardon?
15668,shireenAt Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
15669,davosFirst things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
15670,shireenIs there going to be a battle?
15671,"davosAye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
15672,"selyseThat's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
15673,"davosYes, my queen."
15674,shireenI'm not scared.
15675,"davosWell, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
15676,shireenI promise.
15677,stannisI hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
15678,"jonYou'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
15679,missandeiYou're still too weak. .
15680,greyHow long have I been here?
15681,missandeiThree days.
15682,greySer Barristan?
15683,"greyI failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
15684,"missandeiYou failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
15685,"greyThis is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
15686,missandeiAll men fear death.
15687,"greyNo, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
15688,missandeiNow you have given the Masters what they deserve.
15689,"daenerysIf I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
15690,"missandeiYour Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
15691,daenerysYou are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
15692,"missandeiI can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
15693,"hizdahrMy, my queen, please do not do this."
15694,"daenerysWhat about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
15695,hizdahrI did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
15696,"daenerysIt takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
15697,"hizdahrYes, my queen."
15698,"daenerysAnd in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
15699,"tyrionDon't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
15700,jorahWe are.
15701,tyrionWhat would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
15702,jorahNo wine.
15703,"tyrionI am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
15704,tyrionI know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
15705,jorahI am.
15706,tyrionHave you sailed this route before?
15707,jorahNo.
15708,tyrionYou're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
15709,jorahI think you'll be plenty.
15710,tyrionYou know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
15711,jorahNo. But the pirates are.
15712,tyrionOh.
15713,tyrionThe Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
15714,jorahAnd then they weren't.
15715,"tyrionAnd then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
15716,"jorahThe city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
15717,tyrionI would clap.
15718,"tyrionI suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
15719,tyrionWhat was that?
15720,jorahStone Men! Don't let them touch you!
15721,jorahGet behind!
15722,"tyrionMormont, cut me free! . Mormont!"
15723,tyrionMormont! Mormont!
15724,jorahTyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
15725,jorahYou're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
15726,"tyrionYou? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
15727,jorahI suppose that's why they send them there.
15728,"tyrionIt'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
15729,"jorahWe walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
15730,tyrionWithout luck?
15731,"jorahWe've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
15732,tyrionThat's the best idea you've had all day.
15733,aryaWhat are they doing with the bodies?
15734,waifGet back to work.
15735,aryaNo! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.
15736,waifYou will know why.
15737,aryaWhen?
15738,waifWhen it's time. Not before. Get back to work.
15739,aryaWhen do I get to play the game?
15740,waifGame?
15741,aryaThe game. The game of faces.
15742,waifYou tried already. You failed.
15743,aryaI didn't even know I was playing.
15744,waifWho are you?
15745,aryaNo one.
15746,aryaWell who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?
15747,"waifI'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since."
15748,waifWas that true or a lie?
15749,aryaWhat?
15750,waifDid you believe every word I said?
15751,jaqenWho are you?
15752,aryaArya.
15753,jaqenAnd where did you come from?
15754,aryaWesteros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
15755,jaqenA lie.
15756,aryaAfter he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
15757,aryaI stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
15758,"aryaA man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."
15759,aryaI hated him.
15760,aryaI hated him!
15761,aryaThat's not a lie!
15762,jaqenThe girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
15763,aryaYes.
15764,aryaI'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
15765,jaqenWe never stop playing.
15766,"tyrionSo, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots."
15767,jorahI can.
15768,tyrionYou're not hungry?
15769,jorahOf course I'm hungry.
15770,"tyrionYou're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
15771,jorahI am not your travelling companion.
15772,tyrionWe are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…
15773,jorahDo you ever shut up?
15774,tyrionI sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
15775,jorahWhy?
15776,tyrionNever occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
15777,jorahI'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
15778,tyrionI killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
15779,"tyrionAs miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
15780,jorahWhat do you know about my father?
15781,"tyrionI met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
15782,tyrionYou didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
15783,jorahHow?
15784,tyrionI only know what I heard
15785,tyrionHe was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
15786,jorahWe better keep moving.
15787,manValar morghulis.
15788,aryaValar dohaeris.
15789,manI have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
15790,girlIt hurts.
15791,"aryaI know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
15792,aryaI've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.
15793,"jaqenIs the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
15794,jaqenNo. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
15795,"tyrionWhy Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
15796,jorahDo you believe in anything?
15797,tyrionI believe in many things.
15798,"jorahIn something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
15799,tyrionNo.
15800,"jorahNeither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
15801,jorahIt's hard to be a cynic after that.
15802,tyrionDoesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
15803,jorahNo it doesn't.
15804,"tyrionThe Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
15805,jorahFirst we have to conquer the world.
15806,"tyrionWe? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
15807,jorahThen she rules.
15808,tyrionSo a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
15809,jorahShe is the rightful heir.
15810,"tyrionWhy, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
15811,jorahShh! It's a slave ship
15812,tyrionWhy is it anchored?
15813,jorahThey probably came ashore for--
15814,malkowater.
15815,samPLACE - LATER
15816,"malkoGot a lot of fight in you, huh?"
15817,slaverSalt mines.
15818,malkoThat or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
15819,slaverWhat about the dwarf?
15820,malkoWorthless. Cut his throat.
15821,"tyrionWait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
15822,malkoAnd then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
15823,"tyrionWait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
15824,slaverIt will be a dwarf-sized cock.
15825,tyrionGuess again.
15826,malkoThe dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
15827,jorahQueen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
15828,"malkoWe're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
15829,"tyrionThe fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
15830,tyrionHim.
15831,malkoHim? He's got to be 60 years old.
15832,"tyrionSure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
15833,malkoIs that true?
15834,"tyrionHe won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
15835,tyrionThe Kingslayer!
15836,malkoJousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
15837,jorahI killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
15838,malkoLiar.
15839,"jorahIt's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
15840,lancelLord Baelish.
15841,petyrYes? Lancel Lannister.
15842,lancelBrother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
15843,petyrThat's quite a family to abandon.
15844,"lancelThe city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
15845,petyrWell done.
15846,petyrI'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
15847,"lancelStep carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
15848,"petyrWe both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
15849,"petyrDo you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
15850,cerseiThe Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
15851,petyrOf course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
15852,cerseiThe King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
15853,petyrHouse Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
15854,"cerseiHouse Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
15855,petyrOne's choice of companion is a curious thing.
15856,cerseiMost curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
15857,petyrLysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
15858,"cerseiShe was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
15859,petyrI know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
15860,cerseiIf war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
15861,petyrYoung Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
15862,cerseiGood. If there's nothing else.
15863,"petyrThere is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
15864,cerseiThat's not possible.
15865,"petyrMy sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
15866,cerseiRoose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
15867,petyrIndeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
15868,cerseiWe were fools to trust a turncloak.
15869,petyrMarrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
15870,cerseiI will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
15871,"petyrI would counsel patience, your grace."
15872,"cerseiPatience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
15873,"petyrStannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
15874,"cerseiWinterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
15875,"petyrThat is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
15876,cerseiMy Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
15877,"petyrSer Jaime, then."
15878,cerseiJaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
15879,"petyrPerhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
15880,"cerseiForgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
15881,"petyrYou wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
15882,cerseiAnd if you succeed?
15883,petyrName me Warden of the North.
15884,cerseiI'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
15885,petyrI'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
15886,cerseiAnd I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
15887,petyrAs I said. I live to serve.
15888,trystaneI'm going to ask him tomorrow.
15889,myrcellaWhat if he says no?
15890,trystaneHe won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
15891,"myrcellaDo you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
15892,myrcellaWe can't. Not yet.
15893,trystaneWhy not?
15894,myrcellaYou know why not. Someone will see.
15895,trystaneYou are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
15896,myrcellaHow many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
15897,trystaneI like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
15898,"myrcellaThey don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
15899,doranThey make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
15900,"areoYes, my prince."
15901,doranYou have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
15902,areoI remember how.
15903,bronnThe Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
15904,"jaimeAlright, thats enough."
15905,bronnI'm coming to the best part.
15906,jaimeWe're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
15907,bronnThis song really is all about the ending.
15908,jaimeIt can wait. Up there.
15909,jaimeThat's the Water Gardens.
15910,"bronnOnce we got the princess, then what?"
15911,jaimeI like to improvise.
15912,bronnThat explains the golden hand.
15913,"ellariaUnbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
15914,sandFor Oberyn.
15915,"bronnWell, she's made herself at home."
15916,jaimeMyrcella.
15917,"myrcellaUncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?"
15918,jaimeLet's speak in private.
15919,trystaneI am Trystane Martell.
15920,myrcellaTrystane is my intended.
15921,jaimeExcellent. Good to meet you.
15922,"trystaneWe weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime."
15923,"bronnWhy don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
15924,bronnLet's not do something stupid.
15925,myrcellaNo!
15926,bronnThat was something stupid.
15927,"jaimeWe have to go, Myrcella, now."
15928,myrcellaYou hurt him!
15929,"jaimeYou'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
15930,bronnOh for fuck's sake.
15931,obaraYou're coming with me.
15932,myrcellaI don't want to!
15933,"obaraI wasn't asking, princess."
15934,areoDrop you weapons!
15935,obaraI am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
15936,areoDrop your weapons!
15937,"areoWhen you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
15938,bronnYou fight pretty good for a little girl.
15939,riderHalt!
15940,"olennaOh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
15941,"olennaRumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
15942,margaeryEveryone knew about him and Renly.
15943,olennaRenly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
15944,margaeryBut he was the king's brother.
15945,"olennaAnd Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
15946,margaeryCersei is behind this.
15947,"olennaOf course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
15948,"olennaYour Grace, I have travelled a long way."
15949,cerseiYou must be exhausted.
15950,"olennaPut the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
15951,"cerseiAh, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
15952,olennaAnd the famous tart Queen Cersei.
15953,cerseiBeg your pardon.
15954,olennaI know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
15955,cerseiIf you apologize for that comment perhaps--
15956,olennaYou'll get your apology when I get Loras.
15957,cerseiI was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
15958,"olennaHas the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
15959,cerseiI assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
15960,olennaDo you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
15961,"cerseiAs I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
15962,olennaWhat veil?
15963,cerseiThe Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
15964,olennaI didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
15965,"cerseiHouse Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
15966,sparrowYou are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
15967,lorasI don't pay attention to rumors.
15968,"sparrowYou were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in"
15969,lorasHe was my friend. He was my king.
15970,"sparrowWasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
15971,lorasI was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
15972,sparrowWearing Renly's armor.
15973,lorasWhy does it matter what I wore?
15974,"sparrowDo you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
15975,lorasOf course I deny them.
15976,sparrowYou never lay with Renly Baratheon.
15977,lorasNever.
15978,sparrowNor any other man.
15979,sparrowThat will be all Ser Loras.
15980,olennaWell I think that's quite enough of that.
15981,sparrowFaith calls Queen Margaery forward.
15982,margaeryYou call me forward?
15983,sparrowYes. We have some questions for you.
15984,margaeryI am the queen.
15985,"sparrowYou are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
15986,sparrowHow do you respond to these charges against your brother?
15987,margaeryThey are lies.
15988,sparrowAll of them?
15989,margaeryAll of them.
15990,"sparrowQueen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
15991,"margaeryYes, I swear it."
15992,"sparrowThank you, your grace."
15993,sparrowDo you know this man?
15994,"olyvarYes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
15995,sparrowHow did you come to meet?
15996,olyvarI squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
15997,sparrowAnd what occurred in his chamber?
15998,olyvarWe engaged in intimate relations.
15999,sparrowYou laid with him?
16000,olyvarThat night and many others.
16001,lorasLiar! He's a liar!
16002,sparrowIs there anyone else who can support your claim?
16003,"olyvarYes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised."
16004,cerseiThis testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
16005,"olyvarHe has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
16006,lorasLiar!
16007,olennaWhat are you doing? Let us pass.
16008,sparrowThe Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
16009,margaeryWhat?
16010,sparrowBearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
16011,margaeryTommen! Tommen!
16012,"margaeryYou can't do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
16013,sansaWhat do you want?
16014,"myrandaLord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?"
16015,"myrandaYou're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
16016,sansaWhat others?
16017,myrandaI shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
16018,"myrandaLet's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
16019,sansaHunt?
16020,"myrandaMm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
16021,sansaWhat was your name again?
16022,myrandaMyranda.
16023,"sansaAnd how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me."
16024,"myrandaAre you done with your bath, my lady?"
16025,sansaGo. I can finish on my own.
16026,sansaYes?
16027,"theonI've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
16028,sansaNo.
16029,"theonLord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
16030,sansaI'm not touching you.
16031,theonPlease. He'll punish me.
16032,sansaDo you think I care what he does to you.
16033,rooseWho comes before the Old Gods this night?
16034,"theonSansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?"
16035,ramsayRamsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
16036,theonTheon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father's ward.
16037,"rooseLady Sansa, will you take this man?"
16038,sansaI take this man.
16039,ramsayAre you pleased my lady?
16040,ramsayGood. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin.
16041,sansaYes.
16042,ramsayWhy? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
16043,"sansaLord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
16044,ramsayYou're not lying to me?
16045,"sansaNo, my lord."
16046,"ramsayLying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?"
16047,sansaYes sir.
16048,ramsayGood. Now take off your clothes.
16049,"ramsayOh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time."
16050,ramsayReek? I told you to watch.
16051,ramsayYou've known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.

16053,"jonFirst Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
16054,"alliserLord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings."
16055,"jonAs always, thank you for your honesty."
16056,"samSafe travels, Lord Commander."
16057,"jonThank you, Sam."
16058,"samOh, and…"
16059,samIt's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.
16060,jonMe too.
16061,aemonThere he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.
16062,"samHis little brother, Aegon. He became king."
16063,"aemonAnd before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one."
16064,"aemonGet him south, Gillyflower. Before it's too late."
16065,"sansaTheon, wait."
16066,"theonNot Theon, my lady. Reek."
16067,sansaHelp me.
16068,theonYou're his wife now.
16069,sansaTheon
16070,theonDo what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
16071,sansaHe already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes. It can't be worse.
16072,theonIt can. It can always be worse.
16073,sansaWhat did he do to you?
16074,theonPlease…
16075,sansaYou betrayed my family!
16076,theonI'm sorry. I'm sorry!
16077,sansaYou have to help me!
16078,theonHe'll see us. You don't know him.
16079,"sansaMy family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon."
16080,"theonReek, my lady, Reek!"
16081,"sansaYour name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me."
16082,"ramsayYes, Reek?"
16083,aemonEgg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!
16084,"gillyGet some sleep, Sam. You'll have to speak for him tomorrow."
16085,samYou don't know that.
16086,gillyGet some sleep. I'll watch over him.
16087,samI'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.
16088,aemonEgg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old
16089,"samHis name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
16090,brothersAnd now his watch has ended.
16091,"alliserYou're losing all your friends, Tarly."
16092,ramsayMy beautiful wife.
16093,"ramsayWhen my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You've made me very happy."
16094,"ramsayOur scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He's a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He's hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army's out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You'll be my Lady and Wardeness."
16095,sansaBut isn't your step mother pregnant?
16096,ramsayWhat of it?
16097,sansaWhat happens if she has a boy?
16098,ramsayThen I'll have a baby brother.
16099,sansaBut he'll be the heir.
16100,ramsayI'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
16101,"sansaBut you're a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim."
16102,ramsayI've been naturalized by a royal decree of--
16103,sansaTommen Baratheon. Another bastard.
16104,"ramsayBastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
16105,"ramsayYou didn't know? Yes, he's done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady."
16106,ramsayYour Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.
16107,ramsayWhy? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
16108,ramsayTough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
16109,davos40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
16110,stannisWhat else?
16111,davosThe Stormcrows rode off last night.
16112,stannis500 men.
16113,"stannisSell swords, loyal to nothing but gold."
16114,davosWe still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
16115,stannisAnd?
16116,"davosThis isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
16117,"stannisI retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”"
16118,davosYour Grace..
16119,"stannisWinter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last."
16120,davosIt's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
16121,"stannisThis is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,"
16122,davosYour Grace.
16123,"stannisI've trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years."
16124,"melisandreYou saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow."
16125,stannisI don't know what I saw.
16126,melisandreYou do know. Trust yourself.
16127,"stannisAnd you, do you trust yourself?"
16128,melisandreI trust in the Lord.
16129,stannisAre you sure?
16130,melisandreI have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
16131,melisandreBut sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
16132,stannisWe don't have Robert's bastard here.
16133,"melisandreNo, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins."
16134,stannisHave you lost your mind?
16135,melisandreDo you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?
16136,stannisThere must be another way. Leeches or something.
16137,melisandreThere is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
16138,stannisShe's my daughter.
16139,stannisGet out.
16140,derrykThe beauty from beyond The Wall.
16141,"branWhere are you going, huh? Aren't we better looking than the fat man?"
16142,"derrykThe question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?"
16143,"branEven in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss."
16144,"derrykCome on love, give us a kiss."
16145,gillyLeave me alone.
16146,derrykIf you were my girl I wouldn't leave you alone.
16147,branOne little kiss.

16149,branA man gets lonely guarding the Wall.
16150,branThere's no need to be rude.
16151,derrykWe just want a little affection.
16152,samGet your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
16153,branSam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
16154,derrykLook at his hands shaking.
16155,"samGilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door."
16156,samI'm warning you.

16158,"derrykYou lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. He's your hero. He's a hog!"

16161,gillySam! Sam! Sam!
16162,branAlright. Hold still.
16163,samI said get your hands off her.
16164,branYou're gonna get yourself killed.
16165,derrykRoll over. Jon Snow's not here to save you.
16166,samI killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.
16167,gillySam!
16168,samI'm alright.
16169,gillyYou're not.
16170,sammyJust a bit woozy.
16171,gillyThe next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
16172,samI will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done
16173,gillyI know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.
16174,samNo. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
16175,"gillyDon't be stupid Sam, you're not a fighter."
16176,samWhat kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
16177,gillyJust promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.
16178,"samOf course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
16179,gillyI need more water.
16180,samStay. Please.
16181,gillyAm I hurting you?
16182,gillyAre you sure?
16183,samOh. Oh my.
16184,"malkoA rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
16185,malko13. Do I have 14?
16186,malko15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
16187,slave20.
16188,malkoSold!
16189,tyrionWait! You have to buy me as well.
16190,buyerWhy?
16191,"tyrionWe're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
16192,malkoHe's funny. You have to give him that.
16193,buyerAlright. He's funny.
16194,tyrionThank you my Lord. Thank you.
16195,buyerYes.
16196,"tyrionMy Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
16197,"buerHere's your wages, funny man. It'll last the rest of your life."
16198,daarioHow long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
16199,daenerysDon't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
16200,daarioI think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
16201,daenerysAre you jealous?
16202,daarioDo you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
16203,daenerysI do.
16204,daarioYou're right. My motivations are entirely impure.
16205,daarioDoesn't make me wrong.
16206,"daenerysYou told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
16207,daarioEveryone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
16208,daenerysSo what else can I do?
16209,daarioMarry me instead.
16210,"daenerysEven if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
16211,"daarioWhy not? You're our queen, you can do as you like."
16212,daenerysNo. I can't
16213,daarioThen you are the only person in Mereen who's not free.
16214,"daarioI know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
16215,daenerysOf course
16216,"daarioOn the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
16217,daenerysI am a queen. Not a butcher.
16218,daarioAll rulers are either butchers or meat.
16219,"olennaYou there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
16220,"sparrowIt's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit."
16221,olennaYou should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
16222,sparrowYou should have the decency to kneel before the gods
16223,olennaDon't spar with me little fellow.
16224,"sparrowFor me, it's the knees. You?"
16225,olennaHips.
16226,sparrowHuh.
16227,"olennaA man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
16228,sparrowThe people always do the dirty work.
16229,"olennaSpare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
16230,sparrowA useful talent.
16231,olennaI'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
16232,"sparrowYour grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
16233,olennaDon't you walk away from me.
16234,"sparrowYou don't give commands here, Lady Olenna."
16235,olennaWhat is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
16236,olennaWhat then?
16237,"sparrowI imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
16238,olennaHow do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
16239,sparrowBy the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.
16240,olennaI've read the seven pointed star.
16241,sparrowThen you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
16242,"olennaHalf the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
16243,sparrowYes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
16244,"olennaIf it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
16245,"sparrowHave you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
16246,squireLady Olenna.
16247,"cerseiStarving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
16248,tommenShe's in a prison cell and there's nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there's nothing I can do!
16249,"cerseiNo matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
16250,tommenI'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to.
16251,cerseiYou know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
16252,tommenI love her. I love her. I can't help her.
16253,cerseiWe must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
16254,tommenI will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
16255,cerseiLet me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
16256,cerseiYour happiness is all I want in this world
16257,tommenI know.
16258,"cerseiNo you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
16259,areoPrince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing.
16260,myrcellaYou looked different when I left. You had more hair.
16261,jaimeAnd more hands. How's Trystane?
16262,myrcellaHe'll be alright.
16263,jaimeI'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
16264,myrcellaWhy is it happening at all?
16265,jaimeYour mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
16266,"myrcellaThis is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?"
16267,jaimeIt's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
16268,"myrcellaIt's not complicated at all, it's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here."
16269,jaimeI don't understand.
16270,myrcellaOf course you don't! You don't know me!
16271,"bronnBrothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
16272,tyeneHe's got a good voice.
16273,obaraWe're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
16274,bronnIt's against my code to hurt a woman.
16275,obaraIt's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
16276,bronnI wouldn't say you beat me.
16277,tyeneHow's your arm?
16278,bronnWonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
16279,tyeneYou think you're leaving Dorne?
16280,bronnNo great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
16281,tyeneThank you.
16282,bronnI said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
16283,tyeneI'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
16284,bronnI've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
16285,tyeneName one more beautiful than I am.
16286,"bronnWell now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
16287,tyeneThere was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
16288,bronnWas I?
16289,tyeneThere was a woman more beautiful than I am.
16290,bronnWas there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
16291,tyeneHow's your arm now?
16292,bronnYou seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
16293,tyeneAnd how about your head?
16294,bronnMy head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
16295,tyeneYour nose is bleeding.
16296,bronnIt's nothing. It's the dry air.
16297,"tyeneMy dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
16298,tyeneThe only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
16299,tyeneSorry? Who?
16300,bronnYou.
16301,tyeneDon't drop it.
16302,tyeneI think you're very handsome as well.
16303,petyrI'm sorry about the locale.
16304,olennaNo you're not.
16305,petyrIt felt like the safest place.
16306,"olennaNot for your clientele, clearly."
16307,"petyrIt was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
16308,"olennaYou've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
16309,petyrThe past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
16310,"olennaDon't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
16311,petyrI promise you..
16312,"olennaI promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
16313,petyrCersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
16314,olennaAnd what did she want?
16315,"petyrA piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
16316,olennaWhat kind of gift?
16317,petyrThe same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
16318,"slaveMany worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
16319,"ownerYou and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
16320,ownerValar morghulis.
16321,menValar dohaeris.
16322,ownerPrepare yourselves.
16323,daenerysSitting through the great games will be bad enough.
16324,"hizdahrFor generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
16325,ownerMove yourselves!
16326,ownerYour Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
16327,"ownerWe fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16328,"menWe fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16329,daenerysI think I've seen enough.
16330,"hizdahrYour Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
16331,daenerysI've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
16332,tyrionWhat are you doing?
16333,daenerysGet him out of my sight.
16334,"jorahKhaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
16335,tyrionIt's true. He has.
16336,daenerysWho are you?
16337,"tyrionI am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
16338,"cerseiThis is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
16339,margaeryI know you did this.
16340,cerseiWe are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
16341,"margaeryLies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
16342,cerseiYou're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
16343,margaeryI don't want to see you again.
16344,"cerseiI do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
16345,margaeryLeave.
16346,"cerseiYes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
16347,margaeryGet out you hateful bitch!
16348,"cerseiSleep well, sister."
16349,sparrowThank you. You saw her?
16350,cerseiYes.
16351,sparrowAnd?
16352,cerseiHer accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
16353,sparrowWell she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
16354,cerseiWho will stand judge?
16355,sparrowSeven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
16356,cerseiWill you be one of them?
16357,sparrowI will.
16358,cerseiIf one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
16359,sparrowThen they will be at The Mother's mercy.
16360,cerseiWhat does The Mother's mercy entail?
16361,"sparrowIt depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
16362,cerseiThank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
16363,sparrowDid you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
16364,cerseiI think I may have heard at one point.
16365,sparrowBaelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
16366,sparrowWho carved this altar do you know?
16367,cerseiI'm afraid i don't.
16368,sparrowNo one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
16369,"sparrowA young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
16370,sparrowAnd he has much to say about you.
16371,cerseiMove. Let me go immediately.
16372,cerseiYou will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
16373,cerseiLook at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
16374,endEPISODE
16375,"jorahYour Grace, I want to say--"
16376,daenerysYou will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
16377,tyrionIf only I were otherwise.
16378,daenerysIf you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
16379,tyrionYou want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
16380,daenerysSo I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
16381,tyrionInto your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
16382,daenerysIf you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
16383,"tyrionWhen I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
16384,daenerysAnd why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
16385,tyrionBecause you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
16386,daenerysI have a very large army and very large dragons.
16387,tyrionKilling and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
16388,daenerysSo you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
16389,tyrionI know.
16390,daenerysWhy should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
16391,"tyrionWhomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
16392,tyrionDid he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
16393,"daenerysYes, many opportunities."
16394,tyrionAnd did he?
16395,daenerysNo. Not until forced to do so.
16396,"tyrionHe worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
16397,daenerysSo I should kill him?
16398,"tyrionA ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
16399,daenerysRemove Ser Jorah from the city.
16400,septaConfess.
16401,cerseiMy son. Let me speak to--
16402,septaConfess. I meant it.
16403,cerseiMy face will be the last thing you see before--
16404,"aryaMy name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
16405,"aryaIit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
16406,"aryaLeft onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
16407,jaqenLana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
16408,aryaHow will she serve him?
16409,jaqenShe will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
16410,aryaWhat will she do there?
16411,jaqenShe will see.
16412,aryaSee what?
16413,"jaqenHow can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
16414,"aryaOysters, clams and cockles!"
16415,aryaOysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
16416,thinYour oysters fresh?
16417,aryaBest in the city.
16418,thinYou wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
16419,thinVery nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
16420,manIt's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
16421,thinCan't do it.
16422,"manPlease I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
16423,jaqenThe man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
16424,aryaSo why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
16425,jaqenA girl tells a man that she has seen.
16426,"aryaIf the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
16427,"jaqenBut perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
16428,aryaThe Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
16429,jaqenA man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
16430,aryaAnd then what?
16431,jaqenA gift for the Thin Man.
16432,waifShe is not ready.
16433,"jaqenPerhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
16434,waifAnd if she's not?
16435,jaqenIt is all the same to the Many Faced God.
16436,qyburnThe trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
16437,cerseiThe charges?
16438,"qyburnFornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
16439,cerseiAll lies.
16440,"qyburnOf course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
16441,cerseiI wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
16442,"qyburnI'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
16443,cerseiTell him I need to speak to him.
16444,qyburnI implored him to visit you but he would not.
16445,"cerseiWhat about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
16446,"qyburnYour arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
16447,"cerseiYou need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
16448,"qyburnI tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
16449,cerseiI can't stay here.
16450,"qyburnThere is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
16451,"cerseiConfess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
16452,qyburnGoodbye my queen. The work continues.
16453,sansaWhy. Why Theon.
16454,theonNot Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
16455,"sansaReek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
16456,"theonI was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
16457,"sansaGood. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
16458,theonI deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
16459,"theonThey weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
16460,theonThey weren't. They were only--
16461,sansaOnly what?
16462,theonI can't..
16463,sansaTell me!
16464,"theonI can't, not unless the master says..."
16465,"sansaTell me, they weren't what?!"
16466,theonThey weren't...
16467,"sansaTell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
16468,theonThey weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
16469,sansaYou didn't…?
16470,"sansaDo you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
16471,theonI can't talk to you anymore.
16472,"sansaTheon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
16473,"theonNot Theon, Reek!"
16474,"boltonOur scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
16475,"rooseAnd how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
16476,rooseYou disagree?
16477,"ramsayStannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
16478,rooseAnd what do you recommend?
16479,"ramsayThat we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
16480,rooseA smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
16481,ramsayI don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
16482,daenerysSo have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
16483,tyrionHave you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
16484,daenerysIt's probably my safest option.
16485,tyrionI can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
16486,daenerysAnd what would your father do?
16487,tyrionMy father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
16488,daenerysIs that why you killed him?
16489,"tyrionSome day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
16490,daenerysI know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
16491,"tyrionSo here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
16492,daenerysI'm terrible?
16493,tyrionI've heard stories.
16494,daenerysWhy did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
16495,tyrionTo see if you were the right kind of terrible.
16496,daenerysWhich kind is that?
16497,tyrionThe kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
16498,daenerysI did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
16499,"tyrionYes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
16500,daenerysPerhaps it won't come to that.
16501,tyrionIt's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
16502,daenerysVarys? King Robert's spy master?
16503,tyrionYes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
16504,daenerysJorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
16505,tyrionHe did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
16506,daenerysBut you trust him?
16507,"tyrionYes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
16508,daenerysThe brother who killed my father.
16509,tyrionThat's the one.
16510,daenerysPerhaps I will have you killed after all.
16511,"tyrionYour queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
16512,daenerysI'm not going to kill you.
16513,tyrionNo? Banish me?
16514,daenerysNo.
16515,"tyrionSo if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
16516,daenerysYou're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
16517,tyrionAdvise you on what?
16518,daenerysHow to get what I want.
16519,tyrionThe Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
16520,daenerysIf I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
16521,tyrionI'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
16522,daenerysI fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
16523,"tyrionAnd when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
16524,daenerysThe common people.
16525,"tyrionLet's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
16526,"daenerysLannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
16527,tyrionIt's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
16528,daenerysI'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
16529,jorahYou said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
16530,masterYou struck me.
16531,jorahI've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
16532,"masterYou're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
16533,jorahLet me fight for her and I belong to you.
16534,septaThirsty? Confess.
16535,"cerseiI'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
16536,cerseiI can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
16537,"cerseiI can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
16538,gillyDoes it hurt?
16539,samNo.
16540,gillyGood.
16541,samHow are you?
16542,gillyI'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
16543,samYou know what I mean.
16544,gillyI'm good.
16545,samAre you scared?
16546,gillyA little.
16547,samMe too.
16548,samWho's there?
16549,ollyOlly.
16550,samCome in.
16551,ollyI heard what happened.
16552,samNot to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
16553,ollyFigured you were hungry.
16554,samYou're a good lad.
16555,ollyWanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
16556,gillyI need to check on baby Sam.
16557,samNow then. How can I help?
16558,ollyIt's about the Lord Commander.
16559,samYes?
16560,ollyHe's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
16561,samWe've been fighting them for years.
16562,ollyThis wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
16563,"samWildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
16564,"ollyThe one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
16565,samOlly...
16566,ollyHow can he trust him?
16567,"samI've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
16568,ollyBut what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
16569,"samJon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
16570,ollyYou believe that?
16571,samWith all my heart.
16572,samTry not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
16573,tormundYou trust me Jon Snow?
16574,jonDoes that make me a fool?
16575,tormundWe are fools together now.
16576,tormundLord of Bones. Been a long time.
16577,lordLast time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
16578,tormundWar.
16579,lordYou call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
16580,tormundWe should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
16581,lordYou don't give the orders here.
16582,tormundI'm not giving an order.
16583,lordWhy aren't you in chains?
16584,jonHe's not my prisoner.
16585,lordWhat is he?
16586,jonWe're allies.
16587,lordYou fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
16588,tormundI don't fight for the crows.
16589,jonWe're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
16590,"lordIs that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
16591,tormundGather the elders and let's talk.
16592,jonMy name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
16593,karsiYou built that wall to keep us out.
16594,lobodaSince when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
16595,jonIn normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
16596,"karsiBeat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
16597,jonIt's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
16598,jonDragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
16599,lobodaYou saw this?
16600,jonNo. But I trust the man.
16601,karsiThere are old stories about Dragonglass.
16602,lobodaThere are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
16603,karsiAnd with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
16604,jonCome with me and I'll share these weapons.
16605,karsiCome with you where?
16606,jonThere are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
16607,"jonI knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
16608,karsiIf…?
16609,jonIf you swear you join us when the real war begins.
16610,lobodaWhere is Mance?
16611,jonHe died.
16612,lobodaHow?
16613,jonI put an arrow through his heart.
16614,lobodaI say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
16615,"tormundNone of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
16616,"karsiI lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
16617,"jonI'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
16618,"karsiYou vouch for this man, Tormund?"
16619,"tormundHe's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
16620,lobodaMy ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
16621,"karsiSo would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
16622,tormundThis is the way.
16623,wildlingI'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
16624,giantTormund.
16625,"lobodaKeep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
16626,karsiI fucking hate Thenns.
16627,jonHow many are with us? 5000?
16628,tormundI'm not good at counting.
16629,jonWe're leaving too many behind.
16630,tormundThe free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
16631,jonAnd he knew them better than I ever will.
16632,tormundThey're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
16633,"karsiJohnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."
16634,daughterI wanna go with you.
16635,"karsiI need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on."
16636,wunLokh kif rukh?
16637,lobodaShut the gate.
16638,lobodaShut the gate!!
16639,shoutingWait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
16640,lobodaReady your arrows!
16641,jonGet in line! Get in line!
16642,jonHold the line! Hold the line!
16643,nightsLord Commander!
16644,jonGet them to the ship and come back for me!
16645,brotherBut you'll never make it--
16646,jonNow!
16647,jonYou should be on one of those boats.
16648,karsiSo should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?
16649,jonYou have my word. I've given orders.
16650,karsiDon't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !
16651,"tormundIf they get through, everyone dies !"
16652,jonNight's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
16653,jonThe Dragonglass!
16654,"lobodaYou're with me, lad! Now!"
16655,lobodaGet the glass.
16656,eddFuck the glass! We're gonna die here.
16657,jonGo! Go! Go!
16658,"tormundWun Wun, to the sea."
16659,jonLet's go now! Now!
16660,endEPISODE
16661,"davosA band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
16662,stannisHorses?
16663,"davosWe're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
16664,stannis20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
16665,davosThe northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
16666,"stannisPut last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
16667,"davosUnless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
16668,stannisWe're not returning to Castle Black.
16669,"davosForgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
16670,stannisHave the dead horses butchered for meat.
16671,alliserOpen the gates.
16672,jonIt was a failure.
16673,samIt wasn't.
16674,"jonI went to save them, I failed."
16675,"samYou didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
16676,jonI don't think that fact's lost on them.
16677,"alliserYou have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
16678,"davosYou sent for me, Your Grace."
16679,"stannisFind you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
16680,"davosYour Grace, you've named me your Hand."
16681,stannisYes.
16682,"davosThe King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
16683,"stannisYou're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
16684,davosA boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
16685,"stannisAnd if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
16686,"davosYour Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
16687,stannisMy family stays with me.
16688,davosAt least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
16689,davosWhat's this one now?
16690,shireenThe Dance of Dragons
16691,davosWell that sounds like a proper story.
16692,"shireenSer Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
16693,"davosBut the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
16694,shireenAnd burnt him to a crisp.
16695,"davosThus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
16696,davosDo you like it?
16697,shireenHe's beautiful.
16698,shireenThank you.
16699,davosYou're very welcome.
16700,"shireenWill you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
16701,davosOf course I will.
16702,shireenBut why am I getting a present?
16703,"davosBecause you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
16704,shireenYou'll just have to read it yourself.
16705,jaimePrince Doran.
16706,"doranForgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
16707,jaimePrincess Myrcella.
16708,myrcellaUncle.
16709,jaimeWhat a lovely dress.
16710,myrcellaYou don't like it?
16711,jaimeYou must be cold.
16712,myrcellaNot at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
16713,jaimePrince Trystane. How's your jaw?
16714,trystaneA fleabite.
16715,ellariaWhat are you doing in Dorne?
16716,"jaimeLooking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
16717,doranAnd rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
16718,jaimeWe received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
16719,myrcellaThat necklace was stolen from my room.
16720,jaimeAh. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
16721,doranWe can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
16722,"ellariaNo, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
16723,"doranAnd that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
16724,doranKing Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?
16725,jaimeI'm afraid he does.
16726,"doranI cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
16727,jaimeI accept.
16728,"doranOne more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
16729,jaimeYou have my word.
16730,ellariaThe word of a Kingslayer.
16731,ellariaNo wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
16732,"doranYou are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't."
16733,jaimeMay I inquire into the fate of my man?
16734,"doranTell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
16735,jaimeHe said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
16736,doranPrince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.
16737,trystaneI have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
16738,jaimeYou're a good man.
16739,trystaneOn one condition.
16740,"nymeriaWhy do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
16741,tyeneYou're going to miss.
16742,nymeriaI never miss.
16743,tyeneYou will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”
16744,nymeriaLuck.
16745,tyeneNow it's my turn.
16746,nymeriaYou're too slow. You've always been too slow.
16747,bronnAm I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
16748,areoYou'll find out very soon.
16749,"tyeneSay it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
16750,bronnThe most beautiful woman in the world.
16751,tyeneAnd that's the truth!
16752,nymeriaSlut.
16753,"jaimePrince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
16754,bronnOnly the one.
16755,jaimeI believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
16756,bronnPrince. Sorry about the other day.
16757,jaimePrince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
16758,bronnI'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
16759,jaimeThere was one condition.
16760,doranPerhaps some soup instead?
16761,"aryaOysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
16762,manHow much for your little clam?
16763,"aryaOysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
16764,thinCome on.
16765,"thinSome oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
16766,"bankerLord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
16767,maceBit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
16768,bankerAnd how goes the harvest in the Reach?
16769,"maceVintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."
16770,bankerI'm afraid I don't partake.
16771,"maceSome consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
16772,bankerI'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
16773,maceDid you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
16774,bankerMost unfortunate for the glovers.
16775,"maceIf a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
16776,"bankerWe are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
16777,maceYou are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
16778,bankerI'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
16779,"maceOh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
16780,bankerI don't have that gift.
16781,"maceIt's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
16782,merynI thought that old shit would never stop singing.
16783,"manIt wasn't bad, though."
16784,"merynThe Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
16785,"merynThis is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
16786,manYou're buying?
16787,"merynOh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing."
16788,brothelSell your fish somewhere else.
16789,"prostituteOh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness."
16790,prostituteThey say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.
16791,aryaThree coppers.
16792,jonHere's a silver because the lady likes you.
16793,merynToo old.
16794,headBrea.
16795,"headI have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you."
16796,merynDo you have what I want or not?
16797,headOf course. Of course.
16798,"manFresh? Come on, the lads are hungry."
16799,manNothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
16800,manI'll have one.
16801,headWho let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
16802,merynGood.
16803,merynI'll tell you when we're done.
16804,merynYou'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
16805,headOf course.
16806,"headI'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"
16807,manValaar morghulis.
16808,jaqenAnd?
16809,aryaThe Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
16810,jaqenPerhaps that's why the man is thin.
16811,aryaTomorrow.
16812,jaqenTomorrow.
16813,jaqenA girl has work to do.
16814,"doranYour rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
16815,doranI believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.
16816,ellariaYou write like a 7 year old.
16817,jaimeYour maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
16818,ellariaHe didn't try to make you pay?
16819,ellariaThen maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
16820,jaimeShe will.
16821,"ellariaYou love her very much, don't you?"
16822,"jaimeOf course, she's my niece."
16823,ellariaI wasn't talking about her.
16824,"ellariaYou think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
16825,ellariaI know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
16826,shireenFather. Aren't you cold?
16827,stannisNo. What are you reading?
16828,shireenThe Dance of Dragons.
16829,stannisWhat's it about?
16830,"shireenIt's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
16831,stannisThe dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
16832,shireenThat's just what they call it.
16833,stannisDoesn't make much sense.
16834,shireenI think it's poetic.
16835,"stannisIf you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
16836,shireenI wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
16837,"stannisSometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
16838,"shireenIt's alright, father."
16839,stannisYou don't even know what I'm talking about.
16840,shireenIt doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
16841,stannisYes there is.
16842,"shireenGood, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter."
16843,stannisForgive me.
16844,shireenWhere's my father? I want to see my father.
16845,"melisandreIt will all be over soon, Princess."
16846,"shireenWhere's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!"
16847,"shireenLet me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
16848,selyseIt's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.
16849,"melisandreThe year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
16850,"selyseIf we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
16851,"melisandreAccept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
16852,"shireenMother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
16853,selyseI can't.
16854,stannisThere's no other way. She has King's blood.
16855,"melisandreLord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
16856,"shireenMother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
16857,selyseNo...
16858,daenerysWhere have you been?
16859,hizdahrJust making sure everything's in order.
16860,"announcerFree citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
16861,"announcerMy queen, our first contest. Who will triumph"
16862,"quickI fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
16863,"strongI fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
16864,hizdahrThey're waiting for you. Clap your hands.
16865,"daarioThat one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money."
16866,tyrionThe smaller man it is.
16867,daenerysI'm not putting my money anywhere.
16868,hizdahrKings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
16869,daarioPeople used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
16870,"hizdahrI have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
16871,"daenerysHas your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
16872,"daarioWhenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
16873,hizdahrYou don't approve?
16874,tyrionThere's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
16875,"hizdahrFair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
16876,tyrionIt's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
16877,hizdahrI'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
16878,daenerysThat is greatness?
16879,hizdahrThat is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
16880,tyrionMy father would have liked you.

16882,daenerysOne day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
16883,hizdahrAt your command?
16884,daenerysIf need be.
16885,announcerA Meereenese champion?
16886,hizdahrHow many people will die to make this happen?
16887,daenerysIf it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
16888,hizdahrThose men think they're dying for a good reason.
16889,daenerysSomeone else's reason.
16890,"hizdahrSo your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do."
16891,"tyrionWell said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
16892,announceror a Westerosi Knight?!
16893,"jorahI fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
16894,hizdahrYour Grace--
16895,daarioShut your mouth.
16896,tyrionYou can end this.

16907,"melisandreThe Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
16908,stannisWe ride for Winterfell.
16909,melisandreAnd you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
16910,soldierYour Grace.
16911,stannisPrepare to form up.
16912,stannisTell me.
16913,soldierThe men. Many deserted before dawn.
16914,stannisHow many?
16915,"soldierNearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
16916,soldierYour Grace?
16917,stannisSpeak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.
16918,stannisCut her down.
16919,soldierYour Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
16920,stannisGet the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
16921,"jonHe raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
16922,samSo what are you gonna do?
16923,jonI'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
16924,samBut… the Dragonglass?
16925,"jonNo one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
16926,samBut… you killed a White Walker.
16927,jonWith Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
16928,samHe's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
16929,jonNot enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
16930,samYou were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
16931,jonHere's to us then. Long may they sneer.
16932,jonWhat?
16933,"samI wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
16934,"jonI need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
16935,"samWell, there's Edd."
16936,"samI'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
16937,"samIf Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
16938,samThank you.
16939,"jonYou know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
16940,samThey'll bloody try.
16941,jonSam?
16942,samWhat?
16943,jonSam…
16944,jonYou've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
16945,samVery carefully.
16946,jonI'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
16947,samI'll come back.
16948,jonTo your return.
16949,samTo my return.
16950,podrickMy lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
16951,brienneHow do you know it's Stannis?
16952,podrickHe's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
16953,stannisTrench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
16954,"soldierThere's not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
16955,stannisBolton has women fighting for him.
16956,brienneI do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
16957,stannisI did.
16958,"brienneIn the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
16959,"stannisGo on, do your duty."
16960,ramsayLooks like we're done here.
16961,survivorI surrender. I surrender!
16962,ramsayAnd I accept your surrender.
16963,ramsayLet's head back. My wife must be lonely.
16964,myrandaMy lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
16965,theonGo with her. Please.
16966,"sansaI know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left."
16967,"myrandaDie? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
16968,myrandaYou're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.
16969,myrandaStop! Stop!
16970,manOpen the gates!
16971,theonHe's coming back.
16972,merynI can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
16973,"aryaYou were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
16974,aryaI can't hear you.
16975,aryaYou know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.
16976,aryaDo you know who you are?
16977,aryaYou're no one. You're nothing.
16978,jaqenA girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
16979,waifI was right about her.
16980,jaqenYou were.
16981,waifYou're not ready. Not at all.
16982,jaqenThat man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
16983,jaqenOnly death can pay for life.
16984,"aryaNo! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!"
16985,waifWhy are you crying?
16986,aryaHe was my friend.
16987,waifNo he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?
16988,jaqenHe was no one.
16989,aryaBut if you're… Who's this?
16990,jaqenNo one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
16991,jaqenThe faces are for no one.
16992,jaqenYou are still someone.
16993,jaqenAnd to someone…
16994,jaqenthe faces are as good as poison.
16995,aryaI can't see!
16996,aryaWhat's happening?! What's happening?!
16997,doranI wish you a safe journey home.
16998,jaimeThank you.
16999,ellariaForgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
17000,bronnMaybe I'll come visit you sometime.
17001,tyeneMaybe I'll come visit you.
17002,bronnDon't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
17003,"tyeneYou want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy."
17004,"jaimeWhenever you're ready, My Lord."
17005,jaimeTry not to lose it this time.
17006,myrcellaI'll never take it off again.
17007,jaimeI know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
17008,myrcellaDo you think mother will like him.
17009,"jaimeIf she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
17010,myrcellaAnd you really believe that?
17011,jaimeHave you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
17012,myrcellaShe likes you.
17013,"jaimeI'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
17014,myrcellaNo you don't.
17015,jaimeWhat I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…
17016,myrcellaI know what you're trying to say.
17017,jaimeNo. I'm afraid you don't.
17018,myrcellaI do.
17019,myrcellaI know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.
17020,jaimeMyrcella?
17021,jaimeMyrcella?!
17022,jaimeMyrcella?! Myrcella?!
17023,"tyrionYou love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
17024,daarioDoes he always talk so much?
17025,greyJorah the Andal.
17026,jorahTorgo Nudho.
17027,greyYou should not be here.
17028,"daarioNo, but he is."
17029,greyOur queen ordered him exiled from city.
17030,daarioOur queen would be dead if not for him.
17031,missandeiIt's true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.
17032,tyrionDwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
17033,missandeiA bit “rusty”.
17034,tyrionRusty” Thank you.
17035,greyI am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
17036,daarioYou missed a good scrap.
17037,jorahNone of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
17038,"tyrionHe's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
17039,jorahWe? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
17040,tyrionAnd I intend to help her do it.
17041,jorahYou've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17042,tyrionYou betrayed her!
17043,jorahCareful now.
17044,"tyrionAnd she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
17045,jorahThe second time thanks to you.
17046,"tyrionDon't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
17047,"daarioHe's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her."
17048,"tyrionFine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
17049,jorahIf I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
17050,"daarioForgive me, but why would we bring you?"
17051,tyrionPardon me?
17052,daarioHave you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
17053,"tyrionNot precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
17054,daarioCan you fight?
17055,tyrionI have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
17056,daarioAre you good on a horse?
17057,tyrionMiddling.
17058,daarioSo mainly you talk?
17059,tyrionAnd drink. I've survived so far.
17060,"daarioWhich I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17061,jorahHe's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17062,daarioThey wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17063,greyI'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
17064,missandeiYou are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17065,greyI am.
17066,"daarioHe is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17067,"missandeiIt's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17068,"daarioAnd Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17069,"voiceHello, old friend."
17070,varysI thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17071,tyrionI suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
17072,"varysThe birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17073,"tyrionWell, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17074,varysInformation is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17075,tyrionIf only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17076,"varysIf only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17077,tyrionI did miss you.
17078,"varysOh, I know."
17079,daenerysWe have to go home.
17080,"daenerysMy poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
17081,daenerysHow far did you carry me?
17082,"daenerysDrogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17083,"daenerysWell, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17084,septaConfess. Confess.
17085,"cerseiI have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
17086,sparrowYou wish to make a confession?
17087,"cerseiOnce I've confessed, will I be free?"
17088,sparrowYour Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
17089,"cerseiThe Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
17090,sparrowName him.
17091,cerseiLancel Lannister.
17092,sparrowYour cousin. And the King's squire.
17093,cerseiI was lonely and afraid.
17094,sparrowYou had a husband.
17095,cerseiA husband of whoring every chance he got.
17096,sparrowHis sins do not pardon your own.
17097,cerseiMay the gods forgive me.
17098,sparrowOther men?
17099,cerseiNo.
17100,sparrowNo others?
17101,sparrowSpeaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
17102,cerseiI do.
17103,sparrowThere are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
17104,"cerseiA lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
17105,"sparrowGood. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
17106,cerseiTrial? I have confessed?
17107,sparrowTo a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
17108,cerseiI bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
17109,"sparrowYou have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."
17110,cerseiThank you. Thank you.
17111,sparrowThe Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
17112,"cerseiI will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
17113,sparrowGood.
17114,cerseiAm I free to go?
17115,sparrowAfter your atonement.
17116,cerseiMy atonement?
17117,"sparrowA sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."

17124,"qyburnIf it please Your Grace, he's taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace's enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm."

17127,davosThe wildlings will make a difference!
17128,"jonThe wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
17129,"davosYou saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."

17215,jaimeMother
17216,"cerseiAll I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?"
17217,cerseiI think about locking Myrcella in a crypt
17218,cerseiI think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
17219,"jaimeShh, shh Don't think about it"
17220,cerseiI have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone
17221,jaimeShe's not suffering She's gone No one can hurt her anymore

17583,yaraThe Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte
17584,balonAnd the Ironborn who held it
17585,yaraThey died fighting to a man
17586,balonWhat is dead may never die
17587,yaraWhat is dead may never die
17588,yaraBut they did and our invasion died with them Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland
17589,balonThey we will take more
17590,yaraWhy? For more pinecones and rocks
17591,balonBecause I order it
17592,"yaraWe can defeat anyone at sea, but we'll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies"
17593,"balonNot if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission"
17594,yaraI won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon
17595,balonThen where is he
17596,"yaraWhere is your kingdom We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war That war is over The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers I lost two brothers that day"
17597,"balonAnd I lost three sons The War of the Five Kings, they call it Well, the other four are dead When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will"
17598,"balonLet me pass. You fool, move aside for your king."
17599,"hoodedHaven't I always, brother?"
17600,balonI thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now
17601,euronWhat is dead may never die
17602,euronHas the custom changed since I've been gone? Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?
17603,balonYou can mock our god without my help
17604,"euronI don't mock the Drowned God I am the Drowned God From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray"
17605,"euronYou're old, brother You've had your time Now let another rule"
17606,balonI heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard
17607,euronThey did
17608,"balonAnd when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues"
17609,euronI needed silence
17610,balonWhat kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm
17611,"euronI am the storm, brother The first storm and the last And you're in my way"
17612,"aeronLord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children"
17613,allWhat is dead may never die
17614,yaraI'm going to find out who did this I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live I swear it by the Salt Throne
17615,"aeronThe Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you"
17616,yaraMy father wouldo ve wanted me to rule
17617,aeronYour father does not get to choose The law is clear Perhaps you'll win Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn And perhaps not

17633,davosHave you seen it done
17634,"melisandreI met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn't have been possible"
17635,davosBut it was It could be now
17636,melisandreNot for me
17637,davosNot for you? I saw you drink poison that shouldo ve killed you I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows
17638,"melisandreEverything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie"
17639,melisandreYou were right all along The Lord never spoke to me
17640,"davosFuck him, then Fuck all of them I'm not a devout man, obviously Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same"
17641,davosI'm not asking the Lord of Light for helpI'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist
17642,melisandreI never had this gift
17643,davosHave you ever tried?
17644,melisandrePlease
17645,"davosEasy, easy Easy"

17650,jonNothing There was nothing at all
17651,"melisandreThe Lord let you come back for a reason Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be"
17652,davosCould you give us a moment?
17653,"davosYou were dead And now you're not That's completely fucking mad, seems to me I can only imagine how it seems to you"
17654,jonI did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why?
17655,davosI don't know Maybe we'll never know What does it matter? You go on You fight for as long as you can You clean up as much of the shit as you can
17656,"jonI don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed"
17657,davosGood Now go fail again
17658,tormundThey think you're some kind of god The man who returned from the dead
17659,jonI'm not a god
17660,tormundI know that
17661,tormundI saw your pecker What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
17662,dolorousYour eyes are still brown Is that still you in there?
17663,jonI think so Hold off on burning my body for now

17665,gillyYou all right?
17666,"samYes Yes, I'm fine"
17667,gillyDid I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
17668,samI don't think so
17669,"gillySea, see They're spelled different, but they sound the same"
17670,"samYeah, they do"
17671,"gillyIt was before I learned how to read, obviously"
17672,"gillySam, are you going to be sick?"
17673,gillyWon't be long We'll be in the south soon I'm excited to see Oldtown Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros Are you going to vomit again?
17674,"samNo No, no, no The Citadel doesn't admit women There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam"
17675,gillyI stayed at Castle Black There's no women allowed there
17676,samThe Citadel isn't Castle Black I don't have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules
17677,"gillyI'll stay in Oldtown, then"
17678,samBy yourself? With a baby and no money?
17679,"gillySo if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?"
17680,"samTo my home Horn Hill My father's -- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely They'll take care of you both"
17681,"gillyWherever you go, I go, too” That's what you said"
17682,samI said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe That's all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe
17683,gillyUs and everyone else in the world
17684,"samI don't care about them Well, no, I do, but I don't really I care about you and him"
17685,"gillyI know that, Sam And he does, too You're the only one who ever has"
17686,"gillyIf you think it's for the best, we trust you"
17687,samI'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off
17688,gillyI'd never do that to the father of my son
17689,branThat's my father
17690,"threeeyedThe man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera's father."
17691,branSer Arthur Dayne

17694,arthurLord Stark
17695,eddardI looked for you on the Trident
17696,arthurWe weren't there
17697,kingsguardYour friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been
17698,eddardThe Mad King is dead Rhaegar lies beneath the ground Why weren't you there to protect your prince?
17699,arthurOur prince wanted us here
17700,eddardWhere's my sister?

17706,branBut Father beat him
17707,threeeyedDid he?
17708,branI know he did Heard the story a thousand times
17709,branHe stabbed him in the back
17710,branWhat's in the tower?

17715,branWhy did you do that? Take me back there I want to go back
17716,threeeyedNo
17717,branHe heard me
17718,threeeyedMaybe Maybe he heard the wind
17719,threeeyedThe past is already written The ink is dry
17720,branWhat's in that tower? I want to go back there
17721,"threeeyedI've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return"
17722,branWhy do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
17723,"threeeyedYou think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
17724,branSo why did you?
17725,threeeyedI was waiting for you
17726,branI don't want to be you

17730,"bloodriderHey, Great Khaleesi Move your ass"
17731,"khalWelcome home, Khaleesi"
17732,dothrakiGo
17733,daenerysWhat are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
17734,daenerysYou have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal
17735,dothrakiWe know who you are I remember you eating the stallion's heart Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
17736,"daenerysBecause I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you"
17737,"dothrakiYou were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn't I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You're young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us"
17738,daenerysWhere else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
17739,"dothrakiYes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now"
17740,varysI don't know how you stand it in all that leather
17741,varysIf we could have the room
17742,"varysYou look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat"
17743,"womanIf you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it"
17744,varysI am not a torturer
17745,varysThough it so often is what people deserve
17746,"varysAnd it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
17747,"varysThat's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
17748,valaThe Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
17749,"varysI understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
17750,"valaYes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son"
17751,"varysChildren are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
17752,"valaIf I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do"
17753,"varysYes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
17754,varysThough I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
17755,"tyrionWhat should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
17756,tyrionYou speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
17757,"tyrionYou two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
17758,greyPatrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
17759,tyrionThat's good That's very good
17760,tyrionBut that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
17761,missandeiWho said this?
17762,"tyrionMe Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
17763,"tyrionYou don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
17764,greyGames are for children
17765,missandeiMy master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
17766,"tyrionThere, that's a start"
17767,missandeiOnly the girls
17768,"tyrionOh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
17769,missandeiWe do not drink
17770,tyrionUntil you do
17771,"tyrionAlright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
17772,"tyrionOh, you took your time"
17773,varysSorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
17774,missandeiYou found out?
17775,varysThe good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
17776,tyrionYou see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
17777,greyWe conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
17778,"tyrionIf the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
17779,"greyIf we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
17780,"missandeiWe cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear"
17781,tyrionYou may be right
17782,greySo we will fight them?
17783,tyrionPossibly
17784,missandeiPossibly?
17785,tyrionIt's a conversation
17786,"tyrionTell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
17787,"varysOf course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
17788,"qyburnYour eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?"
17789,arthurBetter
17790,qyburnAnd your father?
17791,arthurNo one's seen him
17792,qyburnAnd no one will That worked out rather nicely
17793,littleWill Lord Varys ever come back?
17794,qyburnI don't think so Do you miss him?
17795,littleHe was nice
17796,arthurHe called us his little birds He gave us sweets
17797,qyburnIt's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
17798,"qyburnNow remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers"
17799,qyburnNo need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends
17800,qyburnRun along now

17802,"qyburnYour little birds now, your Grace"
17803,jaimeWhat did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer
17804,"qyburnOh, a number of things"
17805,"jaimeDoes he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
17806,qyburnHe understands well enough
17807,jaimeSo tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
17808,cerseiThe High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one
17809,jaimeHas the Faith leveled official charges yet?
17810,cerseiNot yet
17811,jaimeThat is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
17812,"cerseiDon't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are"
17813,"maesterAs bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He's arrogant, dangerous You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are"
17814,"maesterAnd what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
17815,kevanCan I help you
17816,cerseiWhy are you here
17817,maceMy mother...
17818,"ladyI was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen's imprisonment"
17819,cerseiThank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
17820,ladyMargaery is the queen You are not the queen because you're not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
17821,kevanThis is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council
17822,jaimeI'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
17823,"cerseiGrand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
17824,"maesterWell, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently"
17825,"cerseiWhat about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
17826,jaimeThe same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together
17827,"cerseiAnd seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it"
17828,"kevanNo, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all"
17829,"sparrowOh, your Grace"
17830,tommenMy mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place
17831,"sparrowOh, I'm, sorry, your Grace That's not possible Not yet"
17832,tommenWhen will it be possible?
17833,sparrowWhen she's fully atoned for her sins
17834,tommenYou've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?
17835,"sparrowNo She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins"
17836,tommenI want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place
17837,tommenI am the king
17838,sparrowYou are
17839,tommenAnd what does that mean to you
17840,sparrowIt means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother
17841,tommenMy mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?
17842,"sparrowHow do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you"
17843,tommenYes
17844,sparrowIt's a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for
17845,"sparrowYou Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees"
17846,tommenOf course
17847,"sparrowWhen your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you"
17848,tommenI still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured
17849,sparrowIt's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it
17850,sparrowPlease
17851,"sparrowIf we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods"
17852,tommenMy grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods
17853,sparrowThe gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There's so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out

17865,aryaAlso dead
17866,aryaArya Stark left him to die He was on her list
17867,aryaHe was not on her list anymore She'd taken him off it
17868,waifWhy? Didn't she want him dead any longer
17869,aryaShe did and she did not
17870,waifShe sounds confused
17871,"aryaYes, she was"
17872,waifWho else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?
17873,"aryaCersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey"
17874,waifThat's a short list That can't be everyone you want to kill
17875,waifAre you sure you're not forgetting someone
17876,aryaWhich name would you like a girl to speak?
17877,"jaqenIf a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back"
17878,aryaA girl has no name
17879,jaqenCome
17880,"jaqenIf a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear"
17881,jaqenWho are you?
17882,ramsayThe Umbers are a famously loyal house
17883,lordFamously loyal to the Starks
17884,"smalljonAnd you, Lord Karstark Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they? But here we are Times change"
17885,"ramsayWhen my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners"
17886,smalljonYour father was a cunt
17887,"ramsayMy beloved father, the Warden --"
17888,"smalljonYour father was a cunt and that's why you killed him I might've done the same to my father, if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own"
17889,ramsayMy father was poisoned by our enemies
17890,smalljonMmm
17891,"ramsayWhy have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
17892,"smalljonThe bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall We're farther north than any of you fuckers Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone"
17893,ramsaySo now you've come seeking help?
17894,"smalljonWe need to help each other The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam Won't take them long to get here"
17895,lordYou think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell
17896,"smalljonIf they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe He knows this place better than we ever will"
17897,ramsayPledge your banners to House Bolton Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends
17898,smalljonI'm not kissing your fucking hand
17899,ramsayTraditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord
17900,smalljonI'm not doing that either
17901,ramsayWhy would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?
17902,smalljonYour father honored tradition Knelt for Robb Stark Called him King of the North Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
17903,ramsayThen it appears we're at a bit of an impasse
17904,smalljonFuck kneeling and fuck oaths I've got a gift for you
17905,"ramsayA girl, I hope I prefer redheads"
17906,"smalljonA girl, aye A wild one"
17907,ramsayI like them wild
17908,"smalljonAnd the boy, nice and young The way Karstark likes them"
17909,ramsayWho's this?
17910,smalljonRickon Stark
17911,ramsayHow do I know that's Rickon Stark?
17912,"ramsayWelcome home, Lord Stark"
17913,dolorousIt's time
17914,"jonIf you have any last words, now is the time"
17915,bowenYou shouldn't be alive It's not right
17916,jonNeither was killing me
17917,othellMy mother's still living at White Harbor Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings
17918,"alliserI had a choice, Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Night's Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again"
17919,"jonI'm sure you would, Ser Alliser"
17920,"alliserI fought, I lost Now I rest But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever"
17921,dolorousWe should burn the bodies
17922,jonYou should
17923,dolorousWhat do you want me to do with this?
17924,jonWear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black
17925,jonMy watch is ended
17926,dolorousWhere you gonna go?
17927,jonSouth

17929,jonGet warm
17930,dolorousI was with you at Hardhome We saw what's out there We know it's coming here How can you leave us now?
17931,jonI did everything I could You know that
17932,dolorousYou swore a vow
17933,"jonAye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life"
17934,dolorousFor all nights to come
17935,"jonThey killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that?"
17936,manRiders approaching!
17937,manOpen the gate!
17938,sansaThis is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
17939,jonWith the peas and onions?
17940,sansaMmm
17941,jonWe never should have left Winterfell
17942,"sansaDon't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don't go, you idiot”"
17943,jonHow could we know?
17944,sansaI spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything
17945,jonWe were children
17946,"sansaI was awful, just admit it"
17947,jonYou were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played
17948,sansaCan you forgive me?
17949,jonThere's nothing to forgive
17950,sansaForgive me
17951,"jonAll right All right, I forgive you"
17952,"jonYou'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale"
17953,sansaWhere will you go?
17954,"jonWhere will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me"
17955,sansaWhere will we go?
17956,"jonI can't stay here, not after what happened"
17957,sansaThere's only one place we can go Home
17958,jonShould we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
17959,sansaWe'll take it back from them
17960,jonI don't have an army
17961,sansaHow many wildlings did you save?
17962,jonThey didn't come here to serve me
17963,sansaThey owe you their lives
17964,sansaYou think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
17965,jonSansa
17966,"sansaWinterfell is our home It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it"
17967,jonI'm tired of fighting
17968,jonIt's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost
17969,"sansaIf we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe I want you to help me But I'll do it myself if I have to"
17970,davosMy lady
17971,melisandreSer Davos
17972,davosWill you stay here at Castle Black?
17973,melisandreI will do as Jon Snow commands
17974,davosYou serve Jon Snow now?
17975,melisandreHe's the prince that was promised
17976,"davosForgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis"
17977,davosWhat happened down there?
17978,melisandreThere was a battle Stannis was defeated
17979,davosAnd Shireen? What happened to the princess?
17980,brienneI saw what happened I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field
17981,"davosMy lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth"
17982,brienneWe've met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic
17983,davosThat's in the past now
17984,"brienneYes, it's in the past It doesn't mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it, you know"
17985,davosWho did?
17986,brienneStannis Just before I executed him
17987,petyrThe Defender of the Vale!
17988,robinUncle Petyr!
17989,petyrMy lord Come and see
17990,petyrI missed your name day Go on
17991,robinA falcon!
17992,petyrA gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds
17993,"yohnLast time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers."
17994,petyrIndeed I was
17995,"yohnAnd yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell"
17996,"petyrOn our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting"
17997,yohnDo you take me for a fool?
17998,"petyrTell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else"
17999,"yohnSlander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him"
18000,petyrYour home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
18001,robinShall we throw him through the Moon Door?
18002,"yohnMy lord My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
18003,"robinDo you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
18004,"petyrLord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"
18005,"yohnYou can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord"
18006,petyrI think he deserves one more chance What do you say?
18007,robinFine
18008,"petyrI bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her"
18009,robinShe's my cousin We should help her
18010,petyrThat was my instinct as well
18011,petyrOur lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
18012,greyYou invite the enemy into our city?
18013,"tyrionI did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18014,greyI don't make peace with the queen's enemies I kill the queen's enemies
18015,"tyrionYes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach"
18016,missandeiOur queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her
18017,tyrionWe enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
18018,missandeiHow many days were you a slave?
18019,tyrionLong enough to know
18020,missandeiNot long enough to understand
18021,yezzanI bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It's most impressive
18022,tyrionAnd now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune
18023,razdalWe came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
18024,"tyrionLet's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
18025,belichoWe want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
18026,tyrionQueen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
18027,"razdalWhen we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them"
18028,"missandeiShe refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains"
18029,razdalAs they have since the dawn of time
18030,greyNot anymore
18031,yezzanYou think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master
18032,"tyrionFriends, friends, friends, please"
18033,tyrionThere have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world
18034,yezzanSlavery is the way of our world
18035,tyrionYou don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order
18036,yezzanWhat does that mean?
18037,"tyrionInstead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
18038,"tyrionSlaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"
18039,yezzanWe do not support the Sons of the Harpy
18040,"tyrionFine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer"
18041,tyrionLet us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
18042,tyrionGive freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before
18043,tyrionMy friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time
18044,missandeiPerhaps I should translate for you
18045,manWe speak the Common Tongue
18046,tyrionExcellent
18047,manYou met with the slavers today
18048,tyrionI did
18049,manOur brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them
18050,tyrionI imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
18051,tyrionBut I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
18052,manYou are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
18053,tyrionBecause our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
18054,manWhen does she return?
18055,tyrionSoon You have my word
18056,manWe don't know you We don't trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him
18057,"tyrionAnd that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace"
18058,manYou have made peace with the slavers?
18059,tyrionWe offered terms
18060,"manAnd you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"
18061,"greyI am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it"
18062,"manMissandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?"
18063,missandeiI do not trust them I will never trust them
18064,"missandeiBut as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18065,greyDo not use me for your lies
18066,tyrionThose men respect you
18067,greyThey respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal
18068,tyrionAs do I
18069,"greyI am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy"
18070,tyrionI am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
18071,missandeiYou promised the slavers they could keep slavery
18072,tyrionFor a short time
18073,missandeiSeven years is not a short time for a slave
18074,tyrionYou're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
18075,greyYou are wrong to trust these men
18076,tyrionI don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
18077,greyYou don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
18078,tyrionThey look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
18079,greyYou will not use them They will use you That is what they do
18080,daarioYou all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?
18081,jorahI'm fine
18082,"daarioI don't think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago, maybe"
18083,jorahWhat?
18084,"daarioOur queen She's wild, you know Don't let her size fool you It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man You, I don't think your heart could take it"
18085,daarioMust make you angry that our queen chose me
18086,jorahMakes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on
18087,daarioWe'll all disappoint her before long
18088,jorahWe need each other right now After we're done needing each other --
18089,"daarioOh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man"
18090,"jorahYou didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?"
18091,daarioNone
18092,"jorahThe road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway"
18093,"jorahEastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen"
18094,daarioWhat are you doing?
18095,jorahIt's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
18096,daarioIsn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
18097,"jorahIf they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"
18098,daarioYou're asking a dog to hand over his teeth
18099,"jorahThere's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her"
18100,daarioUh…
18101,daarioI'm very attached to this knife
18102,jorahDon't worry it didn't touch you
18103,daarioYou know what happens?
18104,jorahI know what happens
18105,daarioI'll do it myself.
18106,daarioI should have been born a Dothraki
18107,jorahCome on
18108,jorahMy friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?
18109,dothrakiWhat do you sell?
18110,"jorahWine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest"
18111,dothrakiYou're not merchants
18112,dothrakiGet the others
18113,"daarioTold you, I'm very attached to this knife"
18114,daarioYou all right?
18115,"jorahIf they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us"
18116,daarioHuh
18117,leaderSome of them don't think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They don't realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you?
18118,lhazareenTwelve
18119,"leaderA year later, she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness?"
18120,lhazareenHe broke my ribs
18121,"leaderWe are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning"
18122,daenerysThat is more than most have
18123,"leaderWhen the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us The other possibilities are not so pleasant"
18124,daenerysI need to make water
18125,leaderYou can't run from Dothraki You know this
18126,daenerysI will never run from Dothraki
18127,"leaderGo, show her"
18128,daenerysI needed fresh air The old women stink
18129,lhazareenThey do stink
18130,daenerysYou must have been very young when your Khal died
18131,lhazareenSixteen
18132,daenerysToo bad he didn't die sooner
18133,"lhazareenYes, too bad"
18134,lhazareenIs it true you have three dragons?
18135,daenerysMm-hmm
18136,lhazareenAnd they breathe fire?
18137,daenerysThey do Would you like to see them one day?
18138,"lhazareenI am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die"
18139,"daenerysNo, don't hurt her"
18140,daarioShe'll give us away
18141,jorahWe have to go now
18142,daenerysWe will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
18143,jorahAll we can do is try
18144,daenerysNo We can do more than that And you're going to help me
18145,"daenerysAnd you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me"
18146,"sparrowIf I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
18147,"margaeryI'd go to my brother, my husband, my family"
18148,"sparrowOf course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair"
18149,margaeryQuality takes time
18150,"sparrowYes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better"
18151,"margaeryAnd one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger, verse 25"
18152,sparrowYou know
18153,margaerySepta Unella reads it to me At me
18154,"sparrowYes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was"
18155,margaerySo what did you do?
18156,sparrowI left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
18157,"sparrowCome, let's go and see him"
18158,margaeryWho?
18159,sparrowYour brother
18160,margaeryenters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
18161,margaeryLoras. Loras.
18162,margaeryhelps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
18163,margaeryListen to me. You need to stay strong.
18164,lorasI can't stay strong. I never was strong.
18165,"margaeryYou are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
18166,lorasI don't care about that.
18167,margaeryShh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?
18168,lorasI just want it to stop. Help me.
18169,"margaeryThey want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
18170,lorasLet them win. Just make it stop. Please.
18171,lorasbegins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
18172,margaeryAll right.
18173,cerseiis walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
18174,"maesterAnd now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
18175,cerseienters the room
18176,cerseiWhat are you doing here?
18177,maesterI am advising the king on our current predicament.
18178,cerseiLeave.
18179,maesterI am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --
18180,cerseiIs this a Small Council meeting?
18181,maesterObviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
18182,"tommenThank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
18183,maesterYour Grace.
18184,"maesterPYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
18185,"cerseiSince I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
18186,tommenI've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
18187,"cerseiAs have we all, unfortunately."
18188,tommenWe need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.
18189,cerseiLook at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
18190,cerseiIt's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
18191,"tommenYou don't like Margaery, do you?"
18192,"cerseiWhether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
18193,tommenMother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
18194,cerseiYou've spoken with him?
18195,tommenI promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
18196,"cerseiIt would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
18197,kevanand LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
18198,cerseiThe Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
18199,kevinand LADY OLENNA stand up.
18200,ladyI would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.
18201,cerseiYou once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
18202,"ladyMy dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"
18203,jaimeCersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
18204,"cerseiThe High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
18205,"ladyOh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
18206,cerseiI agree.
18207,"jaimeYou've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
18208,kevanThe king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
18209,"jaimeYou'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
18210,"kevanNo, but if the king should call on me --"
18211,"jaimeThe whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
18212,cerseiYou hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
18213,kevanOf course I want him back.
18214,cerseiThen stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
18215,"kevanIf it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die."
18216,ladyMany will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
18217,theonapproaches Pyke Castle by boat.
18218,"yaraThey told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
18219,theonI escaped.
18220,yaraI can't hear you.
18221,yaraLook at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
18222,theonI'm sorry.
18223,"yaraYou were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
18224,theonI know. I know and I'm sorry.
18225,yaraStop saying that.
18226,theonHe broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
18227,yaraI know.
18228,theonYou don't know.
18229,yaraHe send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.
18230,yaraWhy did you come here?
18231,theonWhere else could I go?
18232,yaraYou heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?
18233,"theonNo, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
18234,yaraYou happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
18235,theonI didn't know.
18236,yaraYou think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?
18237,theonI don't want to be king.
18238,yaraWhat do you want?
18239,theonI shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
18240,yaraThat doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.
18241,theonYou should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
18242,ramsaypeels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
18243,ramsayThey've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
18244,oshaA lord?
18245,ramsayYes. A lord. You've seen my banners?
18246,oshaThe flayed man.
18247,ramsayDoes that worry you at all?
18248,oshaYou eat them after?
18249,ramsayNo.
18250,oshaThen I've seen worse.
18251,ramsaypeels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
18252,ramsayYou served the Starks?
18253,"oshaAye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
18254,"ramsayThe Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon."
18255,"oshaHe'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed."
18256,"ramsayBe that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"
18257,oshaI can give you what you want.
18258,ramsayAre you sure you know what that is?
18259,oshacomes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
18260,"oshaSame thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first."
18261,ramsayYou're a good talker.
18262,ramsayI like that.
18263,ramsayYou're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
18264,oshaThat so?
18265,ramsayI had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
18266,"ramsayHe told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it."
18267,"oshagets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece."
18268,"sansaJON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction."
18269,dolorousSorry about the food. It's not what we're known for.
18270,sansaThat's all right. There are more important things.
18271,"manA letter for you, Lord Commander."
18272,jonI'm not Lord Commander anymore.
18273,jonSNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
18274,"jonTo the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."
18275,jonSNOW looks at SANSA.
18276,"jonHis direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
18277,sansaGo on.
18278,jonIt's just more of the same.
18279,"jonSNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
18280,"sansaYou will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."
18281,jonLord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
18282,sansaHis father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
18283,jonWe don't know that.
18284,"sansaYes, we do."
18285,tormundHow many men does he have in his army?
18286,"sansaI heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack."
18287,jonHow many do you have?
18288,"tormundThat can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people."
18289,sansaYou're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.
18290,sansaA monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
18291,jonSNOW nods.
18292,khalIt is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
18293,khalSo we don't spill blood.
18294,khalWell… there's always a little blood.
18295,khalSomeone crushed his head with a rock.
18296,khalAggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.
18297,khal1 sits down.
18298,khalBring in Drogo's widow.
18299,"daenerysenters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads."
18300,khalWho cares about her? She's a midget.
18301,khalI like her.
18302,khalShe's paler than milk.
18303,khalI'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.
18304,khalGood. You can suck my dick.
18305,khalShe belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
18306,"khalThe Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?"
18307,khalFuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.
18308,daenerysDon't you want to know what I think?
18309,khalYou'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
18310,daenerysNo. I don't want either of those things.
18311,"khalWe don't care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are."
18312,daenerysI know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
18313,"khalAnd what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo."
18314,daenerysThis is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
18315,khalAnd you were dumb enough to believe him?
18316,"daenerysAnd here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
18317,khalAll right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.
18318,"khalAnd If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?"
18319,daeneryslays her hand on a fire pit.
18320,daenerysYou're not going to serve. You're going to die.
18321,"daenerysknocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows."
18322,sansaYes?
18323,"manFor you, my lady."
18324,sansaHow far is Mole's Town?
18325,"petyrSansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
18326,sansaUnharmed? What are you doing here?
18327,petyrI rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
18328,"sansaTo come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy."
18329,"sansaWould you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
18330,petyrI can't begin to contemplate --
18331,sansaWhat do you think he did to me?
18332,brienneLady Sansa asked you a question.
18333,petyrHe beat you.
18334,"sansaYes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?"
18335,"petyrSansa, I --"
18336,sansaWhat else?
18337,petyrDid he cut you?
18338,sansaMaybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
18339,petyrI didn't know.
18340,sansaI thought you knew everyone's secrets.
18341,"petyrI made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
18342,"sansaThe other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
18343,petyrI'm so sorry.
18344,sansaYou said you would protect me.
18345,petyrAnd I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
18346,sansaI don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?
18347,"petyrDo you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
18348,sansaWhat if I want you to die here and now?
18349,petyrThen I will die.
18350,sansaYou freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
18351,petyrI would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
18352,sansaI have an army.
18353,petyrYour brother's army.
18354,petyrHalf-brother.
18355,waifYou're not ready. You should go home before it's too late.
18356,"waifYou'll never be one of us, Lady Stark."
18357,jaqenShe has a point.
18358,jaqenNone of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
18359,aryaWho was the first?
18360,"jaqenHe was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
18361,aryaWhere did they go?
18362,"jaqenHere. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
18363,aryaA girl has no desires.
18364,aryaWho?
18365,"jaqenAn actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
18366,izembaroAhh!
18367,"izembaroOh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more."
18368,"clarenzoOh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don't die."
18369,"izembaroShut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine."
18370,"ladycI feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
18371,izembaroNed stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
18372,"camelloOoh! Ooh, what's happened here, then?"
18373,"bobonoHe brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you're the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
18374,camelloWe men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
18375,"camelloI'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful."
18376,"izembaroI die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go."
18377,ladyWill you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
18378,camelloThe Iron Throne's what I demand.
18379,ladyYou cannot.
18380,camelloI can.
18381,ladyYou will not.
18382,camelloI will.
18383,ladyYou dare not.
18384,camelloI dare yes.
18385,ladyThe line of succession.
18386,camelloWhat's that mean?
18387,ladyThe proper progression.
18388,ladyThe lawful ascension.
18389,"camelloSo move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble."
18390,camelloBut we had a deal all done and dusted.
18391,camelloI'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
18392,biancaSave my father.
18393,ladyTruly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
18394,"biancaSave him, please."
18395,ladyShow him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
18396,"clarenzoGood people, you may all relax. My father's friend shall be spared the —"
18397,"biancaFather! No! Oh, father."
18398,"bobonoWorry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you'll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life. And he's give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
18399,bobonoYou'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
18400,"bobonoSo let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
18401,clarenzoIt's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
18402,"camelloWell, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."
18403,"camelloOh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
18404,"izembaroYou can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
18405,biancaI had two lines.
18406,izembaroThere are no small parts. You rang very false.
18407,biancaI rang very false?
18408,"bobonoWhat you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
18409,biancaYou weren't complaining about me last night.
18410,"bobonoMay I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
18411,"ladyI'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate."
18412,bobonoOf course we're going to be intimate.
18413,ladyIt's only a matter of time.
18414,ladyTo our children.
18415,bobonoMay they have your talent.
18416,ladyAnd your filthy mind.
18417,aryaA girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
18418,aryaIf a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
18419,jaqenA girl is not ready.
18420,aryaShe's a good actress.
18421,jaqenSo a man has heard.
18422,aryaSeems like a decent woman.
18423,jaqenDoes death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
18424,aryaNo. Who wants her dead?
18425,jaqenThat does not matter. The price was paid.
18426,aryaThe younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
18427,jaqenA girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
18428,aryaA girl has decided.
18429,jaqenA servant does not ask questions.
18430,manNo! No! No!
18431,branIt was you. You made the White Walkers.
18432,leafWe were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
18433,branFrom whom?
18434,leafFrom you. From men.
18435,aeronWe speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
18436,"yaraI am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
18437,manWe've never had a queen. Not once.
18438,"yaraThere are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
18439,allAye!
18440,yaraWe are a sea people.
18441,yaraOur god is a sea god.
18442,"yaraWhen I am queen, we will build a fleet that —"
18443,manYou shall not be queen!
18444,yaraI am not finished!
18445,"manYes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon's own male heir has returned."
18446,theonI am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
18447,"theonAnd she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
18448,theonShe is a reaver!
18449,theonShe is a warrior!
18450,theonShe is ironborn!
18451,theonWe will find no better leader. This is our queen.
18452,euronI'm Euron Greyjoy.
18453,euronI claim the Salt Throne.
18454,euronNiece.
18455,euronNephew. Little Theon.
18456,euronHeard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
18457,euronExplains why you think a woman can be king.
18458,"yaraWhen did you return, Uncle?"
18459,euronA few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
18460,yaraI'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
18461,euronI did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
18462,"theonThat would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
18463,euronGallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
18464,euronDid the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
18465,theonYou were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
18466,euronAnd how will she do that?
18467,yaraI will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
18468,"euronRight idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
18469,yaraYou're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
18470,euronI'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
18471,"aeronMay Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
18472,aersonListen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
18473,aeronLet the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
18474,"aeronWhat is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
18475,aeronWhat is dead may never die.
18476,allWhat is dead may never die.
18477,euronWhere are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
18478,aeronThey stole our best ships.
18479,euronWon't be enough to save them.
18480,euronGo back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
18481,daenerysI banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
18482,jorahYou must send me away.
18483,daenerysIs there a cure?
18484,jorahI don't know.
18485,daenerysHow long does it take?
18486,jorahI don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
18487,daenerysI'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
18488,"jorahDon't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
18489,"daenerysDo not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
18490,daenerysYou have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
18491,"daenerysWell, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
18492,"varysIn the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
18493,greyNone.
18494,varysAnd how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
18495,"greyTwo, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
18496,varysSo it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
18497,greyFor now.
18498,varysFor now is the best we get in our profession.
18499,tyrionIt's not enough.
18500,"varysConsidering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
18501,"tyrionIt's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
18502,missandeiThe people know who brought them freedom.
18503,"tyrionYes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
18504,varysSounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
18505,tyrionWho said anything about “him”?
18506,"manYou stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
18507,tyrionWelcome to Meereen.
18508,tyrionThat's about the extent of my Valyrian.
18509,tyrionThank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
18510,tyrionThe truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
18511,kinvaraYou don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
18512,kinvaraDaenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
18513,tyrionYes.
18514,kinvaraShe has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
18515,tyrionShe did indeed.
18516,"kinvaraHer dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
18517,tyrionIdeally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
18518,"kinvaraYou want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
18519,tyrionI'd settle for obeyed.
18520,kinvaraI will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
18521,tyrionThat sounds most excellent --
18522,"varysA man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
18523,tyrionWe'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
18524,varysI suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
18525,kinvaraEverything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
18526,"varysAnd you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
18527,"tyrionMy friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
18528,"kinvaraEveryone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
18529,kinvaraShould I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
18530,"kinvaraWe serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
18531,branWhat?
18532,"branHe saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
18533,threeeyedHe touched you.
18534,"branI don't know. He was close, but --"
18535,threeeyedHe knows you are here. He'll come for you.
18536,branBut he can't get in.
18537,"threeeyedHe can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
18538,"meeraCome on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
18539,hodorHodor.
18540,branI'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
18541,threeeyedThe time has come.
18542,branThe time for what?
18543,threeeyedFor you to become me.
18544,branBut am I ready?
18545,threeeyedNo.
18546,"jonWe can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
18547,"davosAside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
18548,"davosThe Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
18549,sansaThe Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
18550,"davosI beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."
18551,"sansaHow well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
18552,"davosPrecious little, my lady."
18553,"sansaMy father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
18554,"davosThey may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
18555,"jonThere are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
18556,"sansaThe North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
18557,davosI don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
18558,"sansaNo, but I do."
18559,"sansaJon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
18560,davosI didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
18561,sansaMy uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
18562,jonHow do you know that?
18563,sansaRamsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
18564,"davosThat's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
18565,"brienneI've sworn to protect you, my lady."
18566,sansaYou heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
18567,brienneWe can send the Blackfish a raven.
18568,sansaCan't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
18569,sansaRide for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
18570,sansaWhat is it?
18571,brienneI don't like leaving you here alone.
18572,sansaWith Jon?
18573,"brienneNot him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
18574,"sansaJon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
18575,brienneThen why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
18576,jonNew dress?
18577,sansaI made it myself. Do you like it?
18578,"jonYear, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
18579,"sansaGood, because I made this for you."
18580,sansaI made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
18581,"jonThank you, Sansa."
18582,sansaYou're welcome.
18583,jonDon't knock it down while I'm gone.
18584,dolorousI'll do my best.
18585,dolorousGood luck.
18586,"manShould we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
18587,dolorousI'm not the Lord Comman --
18588,"dolorousYeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
18589,"meeraWe can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn't a cave."
18590,meeraEat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
18591,meeraWith a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
18592,leafGet Bran and run!
18593,"meeraBran. Bran, wake up. Bran."

18595,"meeraBran, wake up."
18596,meeraHodor.
18597,meeraHelp me!
18598,rickardRemember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
18599,"youngYes, Father."
18600,"rickardBut if you have to fight, win."
18601,"meeraBran! Bran, wake up!"
18602,"meeraBran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
18603,meeraYou have to wake up. We need Hodor.

18623,branMeera. They found us.
18624,meeraI'm so sorry.
18625,"riderCome with me, now."
18626,riderThe dead don't rest.
18627,gillyIt's so green.
18628,"samOh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
18629,gillyYou're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
18630,gillyThat's not any better being a nervous mute.
18631,"samI didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
18632,samAnd I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
18633,gillyThat Little Sam is your baby.
18634,"samYes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
18635,gillyWhat did you tell your family about me?
18636,samI told them I met you in the North.
18637,gillyDid you tell them how far north?
18638,"samWell, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
18639,gillyYou didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
18640,"samThe thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
18641,gillyI think we're here.
18642,"melessaSam. Oh, Sam."
18643,"samOh, hello, Mother."
18644,melessaI never thought I'd see you again. You look wonderful.
18645,samOh.
18646,"samTalla? Gods, you're a woman now."
18647,tallaFather says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
18648,"melessaThat's enough, Talla."
18649,"samOh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
18650,"melessaOh, my. You are lovely."
18651,"gillyI am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
18652,"samOh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
18653,"melessaHello, little one. It's me, your grandmother."
18654,melessaMay I hold him?
18655,"gillyYes, of course."
18656,"melessaYou have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father."
18657,samWhere is Father? And Dickon?
18658,melessaThey're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
18659,"tallaCome, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want."
18660,tommenIs there no other way?
18661,sparrowYou're afraid for her?
18662,tommenOf course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
18663,sparrowShe'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
18664,tommenShe's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
18665,sparrowAnd now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
18666,tommenHave they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
18667,"margaeryNo, Your Grace."
18668,tommenI've missed you. More than you could know.
18669,margaeryWe'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
18670,tommenBetter how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.
18671,"margaeryHave you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
18672,"tommenYes, a few times. Have you?"
18673,"margaeryYes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
18674,margaeryYou think I'm mad. I sound mad.
18675,"tommenNo. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -"
18676,margaeryHe is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
18677,tommenWhat are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
18678,tommenI was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
18679,"margaeryAh, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
18680,tommenI don't understand.
18681,margaeryIt's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
18682,tommenWhat about Loras?
18683,"margaeryI love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
18684,gillyIt's hard to walk in this.
18685,samIt's beautiful. You're beautiful.
18686,"samThis venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
18687,"dickonWell, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
18688,"samOh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
18689,dickonBrought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
18690,"samOh, that's a fair distance."
18691,dickonSo do you do much hunting up at the wall?
18692,"samOh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
18693,dickonMm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
18694,"samRabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
18695,"melessaI imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
18696,tallaYour father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
18697,randyllThat's enough of that.
18698,"melessaSamwell, would you care for more bread?"
18699,"samOh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
18700,randyllNot fat enough already?
18701,samI travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
18702,randyllI read your letter. You're to be a maester.
18703,"samYes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
18704,randyllI thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
18705,randyllYour nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
18706,"melessaRandyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
18707,gillyHe can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
18708,dickonThere's no such thing.
18709,gillyI saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
18710,randyllYour way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?
18711,gillyThe Night's Watch came to our keep.
18712,randyllWhere?
18713,samGilly.
18714,gillyNorth of the Wall.
18715,randyllNorth of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
18716,"randyllIt's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
18717,"melessaCome, my dear. Talla."
18718,melessaI've lost my appetite.
18719,randyllHe dishonors us.
18720,melessaYou dishonor yourself.
18721,"randyllYour mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
18722,samI'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
18723,gillyI'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
18724,samFirst light.
18725,samSay good-bye to him for me.
18726,"gillyYou're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are."
18727,"samGood-bye, Gilly."
18728,gillySam?
18729,samWe're leaving.
18730,gillyWhat?
18731,samGet your things.
18732,gillyI don't have any things.
18733,gillyWhat are you doing?
18734,samWe belong together. All of us.
18735,gillyWhat about your mother and sister?
18736,"samOh, they'll understand."
18737,gillyYour sister's dress.
18738,samShe won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
18739,gillySam. That's your father's sword.
18740,samIt's my family's sword.
18741,gillySam. Won't he come for it?
18742,samHe can bloody well try.
18743,clarenzoThe lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
18744,"clarenzoAnd to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
18745,allHail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
18746,"clarenzoI'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
18747,"bobonoDrink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
18748,bobonoThe last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
18749,clarenzoPoison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
18750,clarenzoI limp. And it was he…
18751,clarenzothat poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
18752,"ladyMy firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."
18753,"ladyHear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief."
18754,"ladyOh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow."
18755,bobonoWhat is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.
18756,bobonoIt's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
18757,izembaroYou beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
18758,izembaroNo worse child ever stained this land.
18759,izembaroCurse the day I named you.
18760,bobonoMy greatest crime. Now I must flee.
18761,bobonoThen sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
18762,bobonoDon't fear the winter.
18763,bobonoFear me!
18764,"izembaroThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo."
18765,izembaroI give you Bobono.
18766,izembaroI give you Camello.
18767,"izembaroAnd last but not least, sweet Lady Crane."
18768,camelloGive this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.
18769,izembaroThat crowd was shit.
18770,ladyGirl.
18771,ladyWhat are you doing back here?
18772,aryaNothing.
18773,ladyI saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
18774,aryaThree times.
18775,ladyDid you pay?
18776,aryaNo.
18777,"ladyI remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
18778,aryaYou're very good.
18779,ladyMy final speech is shit.
18780,"ladyBut to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good."
18781,"aryaSo change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
18782,ladyHow would you change it?
18783,aryaThe queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
18784,ladyWhat's your name?
18785,aryaMercy.
18786,"ladyYou have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
18787,ladyWonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
18788,aryaI have to go. My father's waiting for me.
18789,"biancaLady Crane, they loved you."
18790,ladyThey were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
18791,izembaroNo laugh for Nedo s death. These people are worse than animals.
18792,izembaroBut they loved her. They all love her.
18793,"camelloYes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
18794,ladyI do what I can with what I'm given.
18795,izembaroWith what you're given?
18796,"ladyWell, I was thinking- -"
18797,"izembaroOh, we're all thinkers now, are we?"
18798,izembaroFull to the tits with ideas.
18799,ladyI didn't mean- -
18800,"izembaroYou have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing."
18801,izembaroYou have no right to an opinion.
18802,aryaCareful of that one. She wants you dead.
18803,jaqenAnd?
18804,waifAs I expected.
18805,jaqenA shame. A girl had many gifts.
18806,waifYou promised me.
18807,jaqenDon't let her suffer.
18808,maceMy lord.
18809,jaimeMy lord.
18810,"maceMy friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!"
18811,"captainForward, march!"
18812,"sparrowRich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."
18813,"captainCompany, halt! Face front! Turn!"
18814,sparrowLord Tyrell.
18815,sparrowSer Jaime.
18816,jaimeSorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
18817,sparrowI don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.
18818,captainLock spears!
18819,"jaimeI speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
18820,sparrowThe gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
18821,jaimeYou already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
18822,sparrowTo die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
18823,captainOrder up!
18824,sparrowQueen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
18825,sparrowTogether we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
18826,"womanLong live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!"
18827,tommenThe crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
18828,maceWhat's happening?
18829,olennaHe's beaten us. That's what's happening.
18830,"tommenWhen you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
18831,jaimeI've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
18832,tommenI have to answer to the gods.
18833,jaimeNot when you're sitting in that chair.
18834,tommenThe Crown's decision on this matter is final.
18835,jaimeWill I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
18836,tommenYou have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
18837,walderYou've lost it?
18838,"blackYes, father."
18839,"walderIt's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
18840,lotharHe surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
18841,"walderYou did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun."
18842,blackI don't think it's fair to blame us- -
18843,"walderFor 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
18844,blackWe don't have the men.
18845,walderWe've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
18846,blackThe Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
18847,"lotharThe Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
18848,blackRiverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
18849,"walderIf I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us."
18850,"walderI hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
18851,"lotharHe'll never yield, Father."
18852,"walderOh, he'll yield."
18853,"walderYou'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."
18854,"walderCheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home."
18855,jaimeI'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
18856,cerseiBEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
18857,jaimeI'm not going to the Riverlands.
18858,"cerseiWhat, then?"
18859,jaimeI'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
18860,cerseiYou can't.
18861,jaimeHe has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
18862,"cerseiWe should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
18863,jaimeYou'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
18864,"cerseiIt will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
18865,cerseiThey have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
18866,cerseiWe've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
18867,meeraWhy did you help us?
18868,riderThe Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
18869,meeraThe Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
18870,riderNow he lives again.
18871,"riderWhen I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
18872,branWho are you?
18873,branUncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
18874,benjenI led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
18875,branHow?
18876,benjenThe same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
18877,branDragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
18878,benjenYou are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
18879,branI didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.
18880,benjenYou must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
18881,benjenDrink.
18882,"benjenOne way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready."
18883,daarioEverything all right?
18884,daenerysHow many days' ride to Meereen?
18885,daarioA week at best.
18886,daenerysHow many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
18887,"daarioDothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
18888,daenerysAnd who has that many?
18889,daarioNobody.
18890,daenerysNobody yet.
18891,daarioSo we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
18892,daenerysI take what is mine.
18893,daarioYou weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.
18894,daenerysWhat was I made for?
18895,"daarioYou're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
18896,daenerysWait here.
18897,daarioI'm going after her. Wait for me here.
18898,daenerysEvery khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
18899,daenerysI will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
18900,daenerysWill you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
18901,"daenerysWill you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
18902,daenerysAre you with me?
18903,daenerysNow and always?
18904,manThat's it. Get it to the top.
18905,manSteady. Steady.
18906,rayUp she goes.
18907,"rayHey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
18908,"rayHere you are, son."
18909,"rayOh, gentlemen, please."
18910,"rayAnd you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on."
18911,rayIn all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
18912,sandorJust one.
18913,rayOoh. he must have been some kind of monster.
18914,sandorHe was a woman.
18915,rayI think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
18916,sandorI'm used to it.
18917,"rayWhen I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
18918,"rayI was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?"
18919,sandorHate.
18920,"rayNo, there's a reason you're still here."
18921,"sandorAye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill."
18922,"rayNo, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet."
18923,"sandorI've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
18924,"rayWell, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods."
18925,sandorYou're in the wrong line of work.
18926,"rayOh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
18927,sandorYou didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.
18928,rayI've heard stories.
18929,sandorIf the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?
18930,rayThey have.
18931,sparrowYour Grace. What are we reading today?
18932,"margaeryThe Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
18933,"sparrowAh, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
18934,"margaerySmoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
18935,"sparrowYou learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
18936,"margaeryFor year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
18937,sparrowThey are hard to love.
18938,"sparrowThe poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume."
18939,sparrowCan I ask you about a personal matter?
18940,margaeryOf course.
18941,"sparrowThe king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed."
18942,margaeryNo.
18943,"sparrowYou have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
18944,margaeryIt's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
18945,"sparrowCongress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
18946,margaeryForgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
18947,sparrowHard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
18948,margaeryMy grandmother?
18949,"sparrowYes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
18950,olennaDoes it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
18951,margaerySepta Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
18952,"olennaOh, this is madness!"
18953,"olennaYou're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
18954,margaeryGrandmother.
18955,olennauntil I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
18956,"margaeryGrandmother, please."
18957,olennaWhat have they done to you?
18958,"margaeryYou marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
18959,olennaWe marched for you.
18960,"margaeryThe gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy."
18961,olennaAnd what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
18962,"margaeryLoras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
18963,olennaHave you lost your mind?
18964,margaeryand live his life as a penitent.
18965,"olennaHe is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
18966,margaeryHe can begin again.
18967,olennaAs a mindless fanatic.
18968,margaeryAs a free man.
18969,olennaYou will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
18970,margaeryI am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
18971,"margaeryBut you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
18972,olennaI will never leave you. Never.
18973,margaeryYou must.
18974,margaeryGo home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
18975,margaeryThe Mother watches over us all.
18976,"olennaI'll see you soon, my dear."
18977,"margaerySeven blessings to you, Grandmother."
18978,margaeryShall we pray?
18979,"dimWe said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
18980,"tormundIf it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
18981,"dimRemember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
18982,"jonThat's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
18983,"tormundThe crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
18984,wunSnow.
18985,jonAre you sure they'll come?
18986,"tormundWe're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
18987,cerseiI heard you were leaving King's Landing.
18988,olennaThat is hardly your concern.
18989,cerseiYour grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
18990,olennaLoras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
18991,cerseiYou're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
18992,olennaGood.
18993,cerseiI delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
18994,"olennaI wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
18995,cerseiYou love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
18996,"olennaI'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
18997,cerseiNever. I'll never leave my son.
18998,"olennaWhat'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
18999,manPick the pace up. Keep going.
19000,manKeep it moving!
19001,"bronnNow, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19002,jaimeSomeone certainly does.
19003,"bronnOh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
19004,jaimeYou're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
19005,"bronnAye, knights don't get paid."
19006,jaimeYou have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19007,bronnThat's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19008,jaimeI expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19009,bronnYou promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19010,jaimeAnd you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19011,bronnDon't say it. Don't fucking say it.
19012,"lotharCome out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him."
19013,lotharThis is your last warning. Yield the castle.
19014,"blackYou think I won't do it, old man?"
19015,blackI sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19016,"bryndenGo on, then. Cut his throat."
19017,"jaimeLothar, is it?"
19018,lotharSer Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
19019,"jaimeCause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19020,bronnGood thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
19021,jaimeHave Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
19022,"blackWhoa, whoa."
19023,lotharWalder.
19024,blackEdmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
19025,"jaimeOnly a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
19026,blackI don't give a rat's- -
19027,jaimeI'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
19028,"lotharApologies, Ser Jaime."
19029,lotharDo as he says.
19030,"jaimeThe siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
19031,bronnHave your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19032,blackThose are our siege towers- -
19033,"jaimeAs I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
19034,jaimeGet word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19035,bronnA parley or a fight?
19036,jaimeHe's an old man.
19037,bronnYou've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
19038,jonLady Mormont.
19039,lyannaWelcome to Bear Island.
19040,"sansaI remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
19041,"lyannaI doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19042,"jonI served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19043,lyannaI think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
19044,jonStannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19045,lyannaI remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19046,"jonRobb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
19047,"lyannaAs far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
19048,"sansaI did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19049,"lyannaIf you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19050,"jonRamsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19051,lyannaI understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
19052,"davosIf it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
19053,"lyannaI don't know you, Ser…?"
19054,"davosDavos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
19055,davosYou needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
19056,"lyannaAll right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19057,"davosYou never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
19058,"lyannaGo on, Ser Davos."
19059,"davosYour uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19060,lyannaIs this true?
19061,jonYour uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19062,"davosAs long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19063,"lyannaHouse Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
19064,"jonThank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
19065,lyanna62.
19066,jon62?
19067,"lyannaWe are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
19068,"davosIf they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
19069,bryndenKingslayer.
19070,jaimeBlackfish.
19071,bryndenI assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.
19072,jaimeI don't have them.
19073,bryndenPity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19074,bryndenThen why are you here?
19075,"jaimeYou know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
19076,bryndenOr you'll kill Edmure?
19077,bryndenMy nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19078,jaimeIt won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19079,bryndenHundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19080,"jaimeWe'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19081,bryndenYour honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19082,"jaimeThe war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19083,"bryndenAs long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19084,jaimeYou clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19085,"bryndenSieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
19086,"jaimeWell, now you have."
19087,"bryndenAye, now I have. I'm disappointed."
19088,robettThe answer is no.
19089,"jonLord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
19090,robettI've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19091,jonThe Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
19092,robettHave other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
19093,jonHouse Mormont.
19094,robettAnd?
19095,jonWe sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
19096,robettI don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
19097,jonThe bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19098,robettThen the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19099,jonLord Glover.
19100,robettThere's nothing else to say.
19101,sansaI would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
19102,"robettYes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
19103,robettAnd where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19104,"robettI served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
19105,theonWhy did we have to come here?
19106,yaraSome of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
19107,theonI don't want one.
19108,"yaraDon't go far, love."
19109,yaraI'll find you in a bit.
19110,yaraNothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?
19111,"yaraI'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
19112,theonYou think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
19113,"yaraOf course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
19114,theonHe'll find us.
19115,yaraIt's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
19116,theonI don't want any.
19117,yaraI don't care what you want. Drink.
19118,yaraDrink it all.
19119,"yaraYou're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years."
19120,theonSome bad years?
19121,yaraBut I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
19122,"yaraNow listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
19123,"yaraYou escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."
19124,"theonIf I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
19125,"yaraFuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink."
19126,"yaraListen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands."
19127,yaraAre you with me? Are you really with me?
19128,"yaraNow, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
19129,davosStannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
19130,sansaAnd that's a good thing?
19131,davosHe was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
19132,jonWe're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
19133,"davosAye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
19134,jonWe have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
19135,"davos2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
19136,sansa62 Mormonts.
19137,davosIt's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
19138,davosFor fuck's sake.
19139,sansaSo he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19140,jonSer Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19141,"sansaStannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
19142,sansaIt's not enough. We need more men.
19143,jonThere's no time.
19144,"sansaIf we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
19145,jonWe fight with the army we have.
19146,"davosFriends, this is not worth fighting over!"
19147,"davosThis'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."
19148,manWho the fuck are you?
19149,davosHold on.
19150,"manYeah, who the fuck are you?"
19151,"rayI was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
19152,"rayThat night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
19153,rayAll I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
19154,"rayNow, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
19155,rayIt's never too late to come back.
19156,rayAnd it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
19157,"raySeven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
19158,lemWhat are you doing here?
19159,"rayWell, we're talking about life. You?"
19160,lemProtecting the people.
19161,"rayWell, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
19162,lemDo you have any horses?
19163,rayNo horses. No gold. No steel.
19164,"lemFood, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
19165,"rayI'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
19166,lemStay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
19167,"sandorSeven save you, friends.”"
19168,rayI'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
19169,sandorThey don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
19170,"rayAye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
19171,"sandorSure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't. And you've got women."
19172,rayWhat do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
19173,"rayIt'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
19174,sandorYou do.
19175,rayI'm done with fighting.
19176,sandorEven if it's to protect yourself?
19177,rayViolence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
19178,"sandorYou don't cure it by dying, either."
19179,rayYou've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
19180,sandorIt's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.
19181,rayI'll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
19182,manHe's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay. I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
19183,aryaYou're Westerosi.
19184,manWhat do you care?
19185,aryaI want to book passage home.
19186,manYou? Can't afford it.
19187,manWhere'd you steal this from?
19188,aryaWhy do you care?
19189,manWe leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
19190,aryaI want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.
19191,aryaSee you at sunrise.
19192,womanSweet girl.
19193,"ladyMy son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
19194,aryaYou're good at that. Where did you learn?
19195,ladyI'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
19196,"ladySo we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
19197,aryaAnd good at putting holes in them.
19198,ladyAnd that.
19199,aryaWhat happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
19200,ladyBianca.
19201,ladyShe'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
19202,aryaMmm.
19203,ladyI never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
19204,aryaI can't.
19205,"ladyWhy not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
19206,aryaI don't think I could remember all of the lines.
19207,ladyCome with us. What's left for you here?
19208,aryaYou wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
19209,ladyWho?
19210,aryaShe doesn't have a name.
19211,ladyWhere will you go?
19212,aryaEssos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
19213,ladyI don't know.
19214,aryaNobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
19215,"ladyThe edge of the world, maybe."
19216,aryaI'd like to see that.
19217,aryaWhat's that?
19218,ladyMilk of the poppy.
19219,aryaI don't want any.
19220,"ladySleep is the only way you'll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will."
19221,"manThing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
19222,gatinsI was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
19223,youngCourse we do.
19224,"gatinsThis is for masters, this technique. You're not ready."
19225,youngI'm ready.
19226,manHe says he's ready.
19227,gatinsAll right.
19228,"gatinsNow, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head."
19229,gatinsYour right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
19230,"gatinsVery romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole."
19231,manSo fucking close!
19232,"gatinsAh, it smells like pussy to me."
19233,"manLook at him. You get hard, boy?"
19234,youngFuck you! Disgusting old twats.
19235,"youngGot off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
19236,sandorWhere's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
19237,gatinsFuck you!
19238,"sandorThose are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
19239,gatinsCunt!
19240,"sandorYou're shit at dying, you know that?"
19241,"redFrom the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
19242,tyrionI'd call that a successful gambit.
19243,varysWould you?
19244,tyrionLook around. The city has come back to life.
19245,varysYou made a pact with fanatics.
19246,tyrionI did and it worked.
19247,"varysIf you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
19248,tyrionSpoken like a man who has never had to shave.
19249,tyrionI'm going to miss you.
19250,varysI know.
19251,tyrionI hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
19252,"varysIf I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
19253,varysWe need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
19254,"tyrionMost of all, we need our queen."
19255,varysShe'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
19256,varysI'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
19257,tyrionVarys.
19258,tyrionThe most famous dwarf in the world.
19259,"qyburnYour Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
19260,cerseiHave been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
19261,"qyburnThey demand to see you, Your Grace."
19262,cerseiWho permitted them inside the Red Keep?
19263,cerseiThe king is aware of their presence?
19264,"qyburnHe is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
19265,"lancelYour Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
19266,cerseiHis Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
19267,"lancelYour Grace, this is not a request."
19268,"cerseiIt is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
19269,lancelThe High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
19270,cerseiHe promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
19271,lancelHe made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
19272,cerseiGet out.
19273,"lancelMove aside, ser."
19274,lancelOrder your man to step aside or there will be violence.
19275,cerseiI choose violence.
19276,cerseiPlease tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
19277,"podrickLooks like a siege, my lady."
19278,"brienneYou have a keen military mind, Pod."
19279,podrickMy lady. My lady.
19280,manWho goes there? State your business!
19281,brienneMy name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
19282,"bronnGetting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
19283,bronnPodrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
19284,podrickNot yet.
19285,bronnAre they in there?
19286,podrickMm-hmm.
19287,bronnYou think they're fucking?
19288,podrickWhat? No.
19289,"bronnWhy not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
19290,podrickI'm her squire.
19291,"bronnOh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
19292,bronnYou must have shown it to her by now.
19293,podrickShe's training me to fight.
19294,bronnIs she? Oh.
19295,"podrickAn hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
19296,bronnThen how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
19297,"podrickWell, that's a different sort of fighting."
19298,"bronnNow, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
19299,"bronnAll right, let's start with your footwork."
19300,bronnShow me your stance.
19301,"bronnNow, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
19302,"bronnLesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
19303,jaimeI never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
19304,brienneWhy would you assume that?
19305,"jaimeIn my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
19306,brienneI don't think you know many girls like her.
19307,"jaimeWell, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
19308,"jaimeOf course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
19309,brienneI've come for the Blackfish.
19310,jaimeYou're welcome to have him.
19311,brienneLady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
19312,jaimeWith what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
19313,brienneThe Tully army.
19314,"jaimeThey're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
19315,brienneThe Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
19316,jaimeRiverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
19317,brienneAs a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
19318,jaimeExactly.
19319,jaimeWe shouldn't argue about politics.
19320,"brienneYou're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
19321,jaimeI'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
19322,brienneI do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
19323,jaimeWhat do you propose?
19324,brienneAllow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
19325,jaimeWhy would he abandon his ancestral home?
19326,brienneBecause you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
19327,jaimeHave you ever met the Blackfish?
19328,brienneNo.
19329,jaimeHe's even more stubborn than you are.
19330,"jaimeAll right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
19331,"brienneI need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
19332,jaimeYou have my word. You have until nightfall.
19333,brienneYou gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
19334,jaimeIt's yours. It will always be yours.
19335,"brienneone last thing, Ser Jaime."
19336,"jaimeYes, Lady Brienne?"
19337,"brienneShould I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
19338,jaimeOf course it does.
19339,brienneTo fight you.
19340,jaimeLet's hope it doesn't come to that.
19341,bryndenI've said no three times already.
19342,brienneI have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
19343,bryndenI haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
19344,bryndenDouble the guards tonight.
19345,bryndelThe Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
19346,"brienneAs I have said, my name is- -"
19347,"bryndenYes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
19348,brienneHe always spoke highly of you.
19349,"bryndenAnd if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
19350,"bryndenIf you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
19351,brienneRiverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
19352,bryndenWe can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
19353,brienneHe's not my friend.
19354,bryndenNo?
19355,bryndenWho gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
19356,"brienneSer Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
19357,bryndenShe's exactly like her mother.
19358,bryndenI don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
19359,brienneYou have more than she does.
19360,"bryndenShe wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
19361,brienneFind the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
19362,podrickWhat should I write?
19363,brienneTell her I failed.
19364,cerseiThere's to be a royal announcement?
19365,kevanThere is.
19366,cerseiWhy wasn't I informed?
19367,kevanThere is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
19368,kevanWhere are you going?
19369,cerseiTo stand by my son.
19370,kevanYour place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
19371,"tommenLords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
19372,"tommenFurthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
19373,crowdSeven blessings.
19374,qyburnYour Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
19375,cerseiAnd? Was it just a rumor or something more?
19376,qyburnMore. Much more.
19377,missandeiYou seem happy.
19378,"tyrionI am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
19379,tyrionNow it's like a man reborn.
19380,missandeiI will be happy when our queen returns.
19381,tyrionWhy don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
19382,greyUnsullied never drink.
19383,tyrionWhy not?
19384,greyRules.
19385,tyrionAnd who made these rules? Your former masters?
19386,tyrionThose miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
19387,tyrionAnd you? What's your excuse?
19388,missandeiI have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
19389,tyrionThat's how you know it's working.
19390,tyrionHere's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
19391,"tyrionTo Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
19392,greyLong may she reign.
19393,tyrionDo you like it?
19394,greyTastes like it has turned.
19395,"tyrionYes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
19396,"tyrionTell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
19397,missandeiI do not know any jokes.
19398,tyrionGrey worm?
19399,"tyrionRight. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
19400,"tyrionbut when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
19401,tyrionIt's funnier in Westeros.
19402,"greyThe Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
19403,tyrionYes.
19404,"missandeiA joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
19405,"tyrionA story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
19406,"tyrionMissandei, do you like the wine?"
19407,missandeiI do.
19408,tyrionTell a joke.
19409,missandeiTwo translators are on a sinking ship.
19410,"missandeiThe first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
19411,tyrionAh!
19412,greyThat is the worst joke I ever heard.
19413,missandeiYou don't even know what a joke is.
19414,greyI am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
19415,tyrionYou lied to us.
19416,greyI make joke.
19417,missandeiMore jokes.
19418,tyrionI once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
19419,missandeiThe Masters have come for their property.
19420,jaimeLord Edmure.
19421,jaimeI apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
19422,edmureI have your word?
19423,"edmureOh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
19424,"jaimeThe Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
19425,edmureA son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
19426,"jaimeYou should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
19427,edmureDo you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
19428,"jaimeI'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
19429,edmureSays the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
19430,jaimeDid I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
19431,edmureYou understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
19432,jaimeI'll leave the judgments to the gods.
19433,"edmureWell, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
19434,"edmureYour square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
19435,jaimeI was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
19436,edmureYeah. She should have killed you.
19437,"jaimePerhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
19438,edmureDo you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
19439,"jaimeNo, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
19440,"edmureOh. Oh, I see. You're a madman."
19441,jaimeI'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
19442,edmureDon't talk about Cat!
19443,jaimeI'll talk about whomever I want.
19444,"jaimeShe loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
19445,jaimeThey'd do anything to protect their babies.
19446,jaimeStart a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
19447,edmureYou didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
19448,"jaimeThat's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
19449,"jaimeAnd I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
19450,guardWho goes there?
19451,"edmureEdmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
19452,bryndenDon't let him in.
19453,guardHe's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
19454,"bryndenHe's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in."
19455,"guardHe's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
19456,bryndenYou're not obeying Edmure's commands. You're obeying the fucking Kinglsayer's commands.
19457,edmureI demand entry.
19458,guardMy lord has given an order.
19459,bryndenWIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
19460,guardLower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
19461,bryndenI'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
19462,"guardYou are not lord of this castle, my lord."
19463,guardLower the drawbridge!
19464,"guardAye, ser!"
19465,"blackIf you're wrong, we're just surrendered our most valuable prisoner."
19466,"guardWelcome home, my lord."
19467,edmureCommand all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
19468,guardMy lord- -
19469,edmureYour lord has given a command.
19470,edmureFind the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
19471,guardFind him.
19472,bryndenGo on.
19473,brienneCome with us.
19474,bryndenI've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.
19475,brienneYour family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
19476,bryndenYou'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
19477,"bryndenGo on, now."
19478,bryndenI haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
19479,"guardWe found the Blackfish, my lord."
19480,jaimeGood. Bring him to me.
19481,"guardHe died fighting, my lord."
19482,tyrionI was wrong. I admit it.
19483,missandeiThat changes nothing.
19484,tyrionThe Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
19485,greyNo more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
19486,tyrionAnd I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
19487,greyYou're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
19488,"tyrionAll right, what should the army do?"
19489,"greyWe'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
19490,tyrionAnd then?
19491,greyWe wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
19492,bericClegane.
19493,thorosWhat the fuck you doing here?
19494,sandorChasing them. You?
19495,thorosHanging them.
19496,sandorAny particular reason?
19497,bericThey're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
19498,sandorSame reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
19499,thorosYou've got friends?
19500,sandorNot anymore. They're mine.
19501,bericIt's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.
19502,"sandorFuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
19503,"sandorDrop that arrow, you bloody girl."
19504,sandorTougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
19505,bericYou can have one of them.
19506,sandorTwo.
19507,"thorosNo, no, no."
19508,thorosWe're not butchers. We hang them.
19509,sandorhanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?
19510,thorosThey die.
19511,sandorWe all bloody die.
19512,sandorExcept this one here. I'll only gut one of them.
19513,bericNo.
19514,sandorI'll chop off one hand.
19515,bericWe gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
19516,sandorBunch of nancies.
19517,sandorThere was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
19518,"thorosYou're getting old, Clegane."
19519,sandorHe's not.
19520,lemPlease don't. I'll give you anything.
19521,sandorGot anything to eat?
19522,thorosEnjoying yourself?
19523,sandorI prefer chicken.
19524,bericYou ought to join us. We could use you.
19525,sandorI tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
19526,"thorosClegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
19527,sandorLots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
19528,bericCold winds are rising in the North.
19529,sandorAnd you're going to go stop them?
19530,bericWe need good men to help us.
19531,"sandorLast time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
19532,bericTrue enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
19533,"sandorI beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
19534,"bericAye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
19535,aryaLady Crane?
19536,"waifIf you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
19537,waifInstead…
19538,waifThe Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.
19539,waifIt will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
19540,waifHaven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
19541,aryaYou told her to kill me.
19542,jaqenYes. But here you are. And there she is.
19543,jaqenFinally a girl is no one.
19544,aryaA girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
19545,"tyrionDespite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
19546,tyrionPerhaps we should take shelter.
19547,daenerysThe city is on the rise?
19548,tyrionMeereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
19549,"tyrionWell, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
19550,tyrionit proves that no one needs a Master.
19551,daenerysGood. Shall we begin?
19552,tyrionDo we have a plan?
19553,"daenerysI will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
19554,daenerysYou don't approve?
19555,tyrionYou once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
19556,"tyrionProbably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
19557,daenerysThis is entirely different.
19558,tyrionYou're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
19559,"razdalOnce before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
19560,"tyrionWe are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
19561,yezzanThe terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
19562,"daenerysWe obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
19563,razdalI imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
19564,daenerysMy reign has just begun.
19565,daenerysDracarys.
19566,greyYou men have a choice
19567,"greyfight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
19568,"tyrionThank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
19569,missandeiOur queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
19570,"tyrionIt always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
19571,razdalHim. He should die.
19572,"belichoYes, him."
19573,"razdalHe's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
19574,yezzanPlease.
19575,"tyrionTell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
19576,jonYou don't have to be here.
19577,"sansaYes, I do."
19578,ramsayMy beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.
19579,"ramsayThank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
19580,jonYou're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
19581,"ramsayI keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
19582,"jonAye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
19583,"ramsayHe's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
19584,sansaHow do we know you have him?
19585,"ramsayNow, if you want to save —"
19586,"sansaYou're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
19587,"ramsayShe's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
19588,"jonIf he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
19589,"davosThat's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
19590,"jonIt's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
19591,tormundIt's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
19592,tormundYou and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
19593,"jonWe're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
19594,tormundstares blankly at JON SNOW.
19595,jonA pincer move.
19596,jonThey won't be able to hit us from the sides.
19597,tormundGood.
19598,"davosIt's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
19599,tormundDid you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
19600,jonNo. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
19601,davosWe should all get some sleep.
19602,"tormundRest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
19603,"sansaSo you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
19604,"jonAye, for what they're worth."
19605,"sansaYou've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
19606,jonYou're right.
19607,sansaYou think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
19608,jonHe's overconfident.
19609,sansaHe plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
19610,"jonAye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
19611,sansaYou don't know him.
19612,"jonAll right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
19613,"sansaWe'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
19614,jonWe can't give up on our brother.
19615,"sansaListen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
19616,jonOf course he does. What should I do differently?
19617,sansaI don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
19618,"jonAye, that's good advice."
19619,sansaYou think that's obvious?
19620,"jonWell, it is a bit obvious."
19621,"sansaIf you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
19622,jonWhen will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
19623,sansaIt's not enough!
19624,"jonNow, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
19625,"sansaIf Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
19626,"jonSNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
19627,sansaNo one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
19628,davosYou think there's hope?
19629,"tormundI've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
19630,davosIt wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
19631,tormundYou saw these demons?
19632,davosWhat?
19633,"davosNo, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
19634,"tormundOh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
19635,"davosMaybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
19636,tormundJon Snow's not a king.
19637,"davosNo, he's not."
19638,tormundI need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
19639,"davosNo, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
19640,tormundSo what do you do all night?
19641,davosI walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
19642,tormundHappy shitting.
19643,jonMy lady. You weren't at the war council.
19644,melisandreI'm not a soldier.
19645,jonAny advice?
19646,melisandreDon't lose.
19647,"jonIf I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
19648,melisandreI'll have to try.
19649,jonI'm ordering you not to bring me back.
19650,"melisandreI am not your servant, Jon Snow."
19651,jonYou're in my camp. I'm the commander.
19652,melisandreI serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
19653,jonHow do you know what he commands?
19654,"melisandreI interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
19655,jonWhy?
19656,melisandreI don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
19657,jonWhat kind of god would do something like that?
19658,melisandreThe one we've got.
19659,"tyrionLast time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
19660,theonIt was a long time ago.
19661,"tyrionIt was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
19662,theonI didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
19663,yaraAnd he paid for them.
19664,"tyrionDoesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
19665,"daenerysYou've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
19666,theonNot my claim. Hers.
19667,daenerysAnd what's wrong with you?
19668,theonI'm not fit to rule.
19669,tyrionWe can agree upon that at least.
19670,daenerysHas the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
19671,yaraNo more than Westeros.
19672,theonOur Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
19673,daenerysLord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
19674,yaraYou and I have that in common.
19675,daenerysWe do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
19676,daenerysWill their ships be enough?
19677,"tyrionWith the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
19678,theonThere are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
19679,daenerysSo why shouldn't I wait for him?
19680,theonThe Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
19681,"yaraHis big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
19682,daenerysAnd I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
19683,"yaraI never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
19684,theonHe murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
19685,tyrionThe Seven Kingdoms.
19686,theonAll of them.
19687,daenerysAnd you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
19688,theonYour ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
19689,daenerysAnd that's all?
19690,yaraWe'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
19691,daenerysReasonable.
19692,tyrionWhat if everyone starts demanding their independence?
19693,"daenerysShe's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
19694,"daenerysYou will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
19695,yaraThat's our way of life.
19696,daenerysNo more.
19697,yaraNo more.
19698,"ramsayDo you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
19699,"ramsayNo, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
19700,tormundDon't.
19701,davosPrepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
19702,davosGo! Go! Follow your commander!
19703,tormundRun and fight!
19704,ramsayNow.
19705,"karstarkCavalry, charge!"
19706,davosWe'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
19707,ramsayLoose!
19708,jonGet word --
19709,davosWe may as well be taking shits back here.
19710,davosFollow!
19711,"ramsayIt's time, go."
19712,smalljonWho owns the North?
19713,allWe do!
19714,smalljonShow me!
19715,tormundHey!
19716,"manInfantry, advance!"
19717,"davosWith me, lads! Break their line!"
19718,manTormund!
19719,manGet him back!
19720,"tormundFuck this, come on!"
19721,ramsayTheir army's gone.
19722,manOur army's gone.
19723,ramsayWe have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
19724,"ramsayYou suggested one on one combat, didn't you?"
19725,ramsayI've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
19726,jonWe're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
19727,sansaJon.
19728,sansaWhere is he?
19729,"ramsayAh. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now."
19730,sansaYour words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
19731,ramsayMy hounds will never harm me.
19732,sansaYou haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
19733,ramsayThey're loyal beasts.
19734,sansaThey were. Now they're starving.
19735,ramsaySit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
19736,attendantYour Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
19737,mistressYou got my money?
19738,pycelleLater. Go away.
19739,girlGrand Maester.
19740,sparrowSer Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
19741,lorasThere'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
19742,sparrowTo which crimes will you be confessing?
19743,lorasAll of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
19744,"lorasI perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
19745,"sparrowThe gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
19746,lorasI take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
19747,sparrowYou understand fully what this means?
19748,lorasI do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
19749,sparrowBrother Loras…
19750,sparrowI ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
19751,sparrowWill you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
19752,lorasI will.
19753,"maceNo, I can't let them…"
19754,"margaeryFaith is the way, Father."
19755,tommenAll right. I'm ready.
19756,"tommenI have to go, I'm-- I'm late for the trial."
19757,margaeryYou mutilated him. You gave me your word.
19758,"sparrowI've kept my word. Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
19759,margaeryAnd where is the queen mother?
19760,lancelHer litter never left the Red Keep.
19761,sparrowIt appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
19762,sparrowGo to the Red Keep and show her the way.
19763,lancelGet the others.
19764,pycelleWhere's the king?
19765,"qyburnElsewhere, I'm afraid."
19766,pycelleWhat's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
19767,"qyburnPlease, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
19768,"qyburnThis pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
19769,"lancelThe longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you."
19770,lancelWhat are you doing?
19771,margaeryThere's something wrong.
19772,"sparrowYou have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
19773,margaeryCersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
19774,"sparrowIf the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
19775,"margaeryForget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
19776,margaeryWe all need to leave now!
19777,margaeryLoras. Stay with me.
19778,margaeryLet me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
19779,margaeryLet us through!
19780,cerseiConfess. Confess.
19781,septaNo.
19782,cerseiConfess.
19783,"cerseiConfess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
19784,cerseiYou've always been quiet.
19785,cerseiI said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
19786,septaGood. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.
19787,cerseiWhat? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
19788,"cerseiThis is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
19789,cerseiYour gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
19790,cerseiShame.
19791,"attendantI'm very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry."
19792,walderFor House Lannister!
19793,menHear me roar!
19794,walderFor House Frey!
19795,menWe stand together!
19796,"walderMay we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last."
19797,"walderAnd when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”"
19798,"bronnYou don't even have to do anything, do you?"
19799,"bronnYou just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
19800,jaimeYou're welcome to her.
19801,bronnShe doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
19802,jaimeThose two have their eyes on you.
19803,"bronnThey have their eyes on you, cunt."
19804,jaimeNot my type.
19805,bronnNot blonde enough?
19806,"jaimeLadies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
19807,jaimeThere you go.
19808,bronnMaybe I'm not in the mood.
19809,bronnFuck it.
19810,bronnNo need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
19811,walderThis came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
19812,jaimeI'm sure he would be.
19813,walderEdmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.
19814,"walderSo the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
19815,"jaimeHave you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
19816,walderI'm a bit old for all that.
19817,"jaimeNo, but back in your day."
19818,"walderThe purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?"
19819,walderI've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
19820,"jaimeYes, you're a great conqueror."
19821,"walderGo on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
19822,"jaimeThey don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
19823,cerseiShow me.
19824,"qyburnYour Grace, there's no need--"
19825,"qyburnWhat are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
19826,"cerseiHe should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
19827,samHello.
19828,samFrom Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
19829,samI'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
19830,maesterOh.
19831,"maesterAccording to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
19832,samHe died.
19833,maesterWe received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
19834,samMaester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
19835,maesterThis is irregular.
19836,"samYes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
19837,"maesterThe archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
19838,maesterNo women or children!
19839,"jonWhen we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
19840,"melisandreCould have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
19841,"jonAye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
19842,jonWhat is that?
19843,davosTell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
19844,melisandreThe Princess Shireen.
19845,davosTell him what you did to her. Tell him!
19846,melisandreWe burned her at the stake.
19847,davosWhy?
19848,melisandreThe army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
19849,davosYou burned a little girl alive!
19850,melisandreI only do what my Lord commands!
19851,"davosIf he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
19852,melisandreWe are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
19853,davosI loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
19854,melisandreSo did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
19855,"davosThe only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
19856,melisandreI didn't lie. I was wrong.
19857,"davosAye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
19858,davosI ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
19859,jonDo you have anything to say for yourself?
19860,"melisandreI've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
19861,"jonRide south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
19862,"davosIf you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
19863,jonI'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
19864,sansaMother and Father's room? You should take it.
19865,jonI'm not a Stark.
19866,sansaYou are to me.
19867,jonYou're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
19868,sansaHe did.
19869,jonAnd you trust him?
19870,"sansaOnly a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
19871,jonWe need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
19872,sansaJon.
19873,sansaA raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
19874,"jonWell, Father always promised, didn't he?"
19875,"olennaThe last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
19876,"ellariaYou have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
19877,"olennaYou murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
19878,obaraWe invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
19879,olennaWhat is your name again? Barbaro?
19880,obaraObara.
19881,olennaObara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
19882,"nymeriaForgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
19883,"olennaDo shut up, dear."
19884,olennaAnything from you?
19885,olennaNo? Good. Let the grown women speak.
19886,ellariaThe Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
19887,olennaCersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
19888,ellariaYou're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.
19889,olennaAnd what is my heart's desire?
19890,ellariaVengeance. Justice.
19891,varysFire and blood.
19892,daarioYour ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
19893,daarioI'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
19894,daenerysYou're not coming with us.
19895,"daarioNew strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing."
19896,daenerysYou're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
19897,"daarioFuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them."
19898,"daenerysYou promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
19899,daarioWho are you marrying this time?
19900,daenerysI don't know. Maybe no one.
19901,daarioBut you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
19902,daenerysI can't bring a lover to Westeros.
19903,daarioA king wouldn't think twice about it.
19904,daenerysSo that's what you want? To be my mistress?
19905,daarioI'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
19906,daarioI love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
19907,daenerysI can't.
19908,daarioThe dwarf told you to do this.
19909,daenerysNo one tells me to do anything.
19910,daarioClever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.
19911,daenerysDon't get angry.
19912,"daarioI'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
19913,"daenerysA great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
19914,daarioBay of Dragons?
19915,"daenerysWe can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
19916,"daarioYou'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
19917,daarioI pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what's coming for them.
19918,"daenerysFarewell, Daario Naharis."
19919,tyrionHow did he take it?
19920,daenerysNo tears.
19921,"tyrionI know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
19922,daenerysIt's not.
19923,"tyrionNo, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
19924,"daenerysYes, you really are."
19925,"tyrionAll right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
19926,tyrionGood. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
19927,daenerysDo you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
19928,tyrionHe wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
19929,"daenerysWell, you have completely failed to console me."
19930,"tyrionFor what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
19931,"tyrionI believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
19932,daenerysIt's your counsel I need.
19933,tyrionIt's yours. Now and always.
19934,"daenerysGood. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
19935,"daenerysTyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
19936,"walderYou're not one of mine, are you?"
19937,"handmaidenNo, my lord."
19938,walderDidn't think so. Too pretty.
19939,walderWhere are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
19940,"handmaidenThey're here, my lord."
19941,"walderWell, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
19942,"handmaidenBut they're already here, my lord."
19943,"handmaidenHere, my lord."
19944,handmaidenThey weren't easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
19945,walderWhat…
19946,aryaMy name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
19947,"petyrForgive me, my lady… if you're at prayer."
19948,"sansaI'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
19949,sansaI was a stupid girl.
19950,petyrYou were a child.
19951,sansaWhat do you want?
19952,petyrI thought you knew what I wanted.
19953,sansaI was wrong.
19954,"petyrNo, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
19955,sansaIt's a pretty picture.
19956,petyrNews of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
19957,"sansaYou've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
19958,"petyrThe past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
19959,benjenThis is where I leave you.
19960,meeraYou're not coming with us?
19961,"benjenThe Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
19962,meeraWhere will you go?
19963,benjenThe great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can… as long as I can.
19964,"branThank you, Uncle Benjen."
19965,benjenI wish you both good fortune.
19966,meeraAre you sure you're ready for this?
19967,branI'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
19968,lyannaNed?
19969,eddardLyanna.
19970,lyannaIs that you? Is that really you?
19971,lyannaYou're not a dream.
19972,"eddardNo, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here."
19973,"lyannaI've missed you, big brother."
19974,"eddardI've missed you, too."
19975,lyannaI want to be brave.
19976,eddardShh. You are.
19977,lyannaI'm not.
19978,lyannaI don't want to die.
19979,eddardYou're not going to die.
19980,eddardGet her some water!
19981,"lyannaNo, no water."
19982,eddardIs there a maester?
19983,"lyannaPlease. Listen to me, Ned."
19984,"lyannaIf Robert finds out, he'll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
19985,"lyannaPromise me, Ned. Promise me."
19986,valeYou can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
19987,tormundWe didn't invade. We were invited.
19988,valeNot by me.
19989,"jonThe free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
19990,"manThe Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
19991,"jonThe war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
19992,"lyannaYour son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day."
19993,"manderlyLady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime. I didn't commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
19994,gloverI did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
19995,"jonThere's nothing to forgive, my lord."
19996,gloverThere will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
19997,gloverThe King in the North!
19998,allThe King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
19999,jaimeCome on.
20000,"qyburnI now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms."
20001,qyburnLong may she reign.
20002,allLong may she reign.
20003,"walderYou're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
20004,"walderWell, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
20005,"walderI've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
20006,walderyStand together!
20007,allStand together!
20008,walderNot you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
20009,"walderMaybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
20010,"walderYes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
20011,"walderNo, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."
20012,walderLeave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
20013,"aryaWhen people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."
20014,eddYou wildlings?
20015,"meeraI'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
20016,eddHow do I know that's true?
20017,branYou were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
20018,"eddOkay, come on. Let's get them inside."
20019,"jonI want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
20020,robettIt's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
20021,jonNot just the boys.
20022,jonWe can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
20023,robettYou expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
20024,"lyannaI don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
20025,"robettIndeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
20026,lyannaAnd I don't need your permission to defend the North.
20027,"lyannaWe'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
20028,"jonWhile we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
20029,jonBut if we're going to survive this winter together...
20030,tormundYou want us to man the castles for you?
20031,jonLast time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
20032,tormundThen that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
20033,"jonIf they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
20034,yohnThe Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
20035,"sansaThe castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
20036,allAye!
20037,jonThe Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
20038,sansaAnd then they broke faith.
20039,jonI'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
20040,sansaSo there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
20041,jonThe punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
20042,sansaThey died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
20043,"jonWhen I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
20044,jonNed Umber.
20045,jonAlys Karstark.
20046,"jonFor centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
20047,jonStand.
20048,"jonYesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
20049,nedNow and always!
20050,"jonYou are my sister, but I am king now."
20051,sansaWill you start wearing a crown?
20052,"jonWhen you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20053,sansaSo I can't question your decisions anymore?
20054,"jonOf course you can, but--"
20055,sansaJoffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20056,jonDo you think I'm Joffrey?
20057,sansaYou're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
20058,jonThank you.
20059,"sansaYou're good at this, you know."
20060,jonAt what?
20061,sansaAt ruling.
20062,jonNo.
20063,"sansaYou are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
20064,sansaWhy are you laughing?
20065,"jonWhat did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
20066,sansaHe never said that to me.
20067,"jonNo. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20068,"sansaBecause he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20069,"jonAll right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20070,sansaI'm not trying to undermine you.
20071,"sansaYou have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20072,jonAnd how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20073,sansaWould that be so terrible?
20074,"wolkanA raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
20075,"jonCersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
20076,sansaWhat does she want?
20077,jonCome to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20078,"sansaYou've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20079,"jonI'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20080,sansaWe still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20081,jonThere's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20082,"sansaYou're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20083,jonYou almost sound as if you admire her.
20084,sansaI learned a great deal from her.
20085,jaimeWhat is this?
20086,"cerseiIts what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20087,"jaimeHe knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20088,"cerseiIt's ours now, we just have to take it."
20089,cerseiYou've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20090,"jaimeNo, not angry."
20091,cerseiAre you afraid of me?
20092,jaimeShould I be?
20093,"cerseiDaenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
20094,jaimeDragonstone.
20095,"jaimeThey have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20096,cerseiEnemies to the east.
20097,cerseiEnemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
20098,"cerseiEnemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
20099,cerseiEnemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20100,"jaimeWinter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20101,cerseiWill the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20102,"jaimeIf they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
20103,cerseiI'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
20104,"jaimeThree kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
20105,cerseiI understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20106,jaimeA dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
20107,"cerseiA dynasty for us, then."
20108,jaimeWe never talked about Tommen.
20109,cerseiThere's nothing to say.
20110,jaimeOur baby boy killed himself.
20111,"cerseiHe betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
20112,jaimeCersei--
20113,"cerseiI loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
20114,jaimeEven Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
20115,cerseiI heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20116,"jaimeWe couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20117,cerseiYou think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20118,jaimeThe Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20119,cerseiNot all of them.
20120,"jaimeWell, it looks like all of them."
20121,"cerseiI invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20122,jaimeHow are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20123,"cerseiSo does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20124,"jaimeThey're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20125,cerseiEuron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20126,"jaimeOh, what did he come here for, then?"
20127,cerseiA queen.
20128,"euronThe moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20129,"euronIt's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20130,"jaimeYou're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20131,"jaimeThe Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20132,"euronI remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20133,jaimeThe people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20134,euronThe place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20135,jaimeAnd I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20136,"euronA good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20137,cerseiIf not the most humble.
20138,"euronYou're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20139,cerseiWhat do you want in return?
20140,"euronEver since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20141,cerseiI decline your proposal.
20142,euronWhy?
20143,cerseiYou're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20144,euronYou should try it. Feels wonderful.
20145,"euronI don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20146,"marwynAh, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20147,marwynWeigh that.
20148,marwynThe triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
20149,"samArchmaester, I was wondering..."
20150,marwynWhat's the weight?
20151,"samUm, 147."
20152,samI was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20153,marwynI don't remember your proposition.
20154,"samI asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20155,marwynThat area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20156,samNo.
20157,"marwynNot a very strong proposition, is it?"
20158,"samArchmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20159,marwynEveryone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20160,samSources in the restricted area?
20161,marwynThe very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20162,"samSo, you believe me."
20163,marwynI do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20164,samThat makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20165,"marwynWe're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20166,marwynBe a good lad. Clean this up.
20167,brienneNope.
20168,tormundYou're a lucky man.
20169,petyrI've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
20170,"sansaWhat do you want, Lord Baelish?"
20171,petyrI want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20172,"sansaI am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20173,petyrWhat about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20174,"sansaAt the moment, peace and quiet."
20175,"sansaNo need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
20176,petyrMy lady.
20177,brienneWhy is he still here?
20178,"sansaWe need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20179,brienneHe wants something.
20180,sansaI know exactly what he wants.
20181,manHe rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20182,aryaThat's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
20183,manIt's a new one.
20184,manAre you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
20185,aryaI don't want to steal your food.
20186,"manYou're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
20187,manYou heading south?
20188,aryaKing's Landing.
20189,manPoor girl.
20190,"aryaNot so bad, is it?"
20191,"manDepends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20192,"manAll my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20193,"manThe people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
20194,manWorst place in the world.
20195,aryaWhat are you doing in the Riverlands?
20196,"manThere's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
20197,manHere you go. Guests first.
20198,"aryaOh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
20199,manMy mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
20200,"aryaYou're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
20201,"manYeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
20202,"man3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
20203,manI just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
20204,manMy wife's just had our first baby.
20205,aryaBoy or girl?
20206,"manOh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
20207,manI hope it's a girl.
20208,aryaWhy?
20209,manGirls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
20210,manAre you old enough to drink?
20211,manIt's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
20212,aryaIt's really good.
20213,"manSo, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
20214,aryaI'm going to kill the queen.
20215,thorosBad night to be outdoors.
20216,"sandorYou've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20217,"thorosYou're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20218,sandorDon't like that shit. It's too sweet.
20219,thorosWhy are you always in such a foul mood?
20220,sandorExperience.
20221,bericThis seems like a good place to spend the night.
20222,sandorThese people don't want us here.
20223,bericSeems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20224,sandorI don't like the look of it.
20225,"thorosFor a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20226,sandorI'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20227,thorosCome on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20228,sandorThey don't.
20229,thorosSee if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20230,bericHow do you think it ended for them?
20231,sandorWith death.
20232,"bericGirl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
20233,sandorDoesn't matter now.
20234,"bericNo, doesn't matter now."
20235,"sandorI've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
20236,bericAye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
20237,sandorAnd I always thought you were dull as dirt.
20238,"sandorYou're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
20239,"bericThank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
20240,sandorBut there's nothing special about you.
20241,bericYou're right about that.
20242,"sandorSo why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
20243,bericYou think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
20244,sandorAnd?
20245,bericI don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
20246,sandorYour Lord.
20247,bericI don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
20248,"sandorIf he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
20249,thorosClegane.
20250,thorosCome over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
20251,sandorIt's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
20252,bericAye. Almost seems like divine justice.
20253,"sandorThere's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
20254,sandorWhat do you want?
20255,thorosLook into the flames.
20256,sandorI don't want to look in the damn flames.
20257,thorosYou saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
20258,sandorI keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
20259,thorosWe can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
20260,thorosWhat do you see?
20261,sandorLogs burning.
20262,thorosKeep looking. What do you see?
20263,sandorIce. A wall of ice. The Wall.
20264,thorosWhat else?
20265,sandorIt's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
20266,sandorThere's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
20267,sandorThousands of them.
20268,"bericDo you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
20269,"thorosWhat the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
20270,sandorBurying the dead.
20271,thorosYou knew these people.
20272,sandorNot really.
20273,"sandorWe ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
20274,littleMom.
20275,"gillyYou should really sleep, Sam."
20276,samThe dead don't.
20277,gillyLegends of the Long Night.
20278,samThe Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
20279,gillyWhat is it?
20280,samIt's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
20281,gillyThat's dragonglass?
20282,"samA mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
20283,jorahHas she come yet?
20284,samWho?
20285,jorahThe Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
20286,samHaven't heard anything.
20287,daenerysShall we begin?
20288,"tyrionOn a night like this, you came into the world."
20289,varysI remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
20290,daenerysI wish I could remember it.
20291,daenerysI always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
20292,tyrionWe won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
20293,daenerysGood.
20294,daenerysNot so many lions.
20295,"varysCersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
20296,daenerysThey cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
20297,"daenerysPeople used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
20298,"daenerysIf Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
20299,tyrionConquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
20300,daenerysNo.
20301,"tyrionWe can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
20302,daenerysI never properly thanked you for that.
20303,"varysThey joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
20304,"daenerysYou served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
20305,varysI did.
20306,daenerysAnd then you served the man who overthrew him?
20307,"varysI had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
20308,daenerysBut you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
20309,"varysRobert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
20310,daenerysSo you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
20311,"tyrionYour Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
20312,"daenerysBefore I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
20313,"varysUntil your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
20314,daenerysSo you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
20315,varysWhich you turned to your advantage.
20316,daenerysWho gave the order to kill me?
20317,varysKing Robert.
20318,daenerysWho hired the assassins?
20319,daenerysWho sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
20320,"varysYour Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
20321,daenerysTo keep yourself alive.
20322,tyrionLord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
20323,"daenerysProven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
20324,"varysThe kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
20325,"daenerysSwear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
20326,"varysI swear it, my queen."
20327,"daenerysAnd I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
20328,varysI would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
20329,"greyForgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
20330,"melisandreQueen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
20331,daenerysThe Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
20332,melisandreI am called Melisandre.
20333,"varysShe once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
20334,"melisandreNo, it didn't."
20335,daenerysYou chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
20336,daenerysWe've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
20337,"daenerysThe Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
20338,melisandreNot yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
20339,daenerysWhat does your Lord expect from me?
20340,melisandreThe Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
20341,daenerysThe prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
20342,"missandeiYour Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
20343,"tyrionDoesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
20344,"daenerysNo, but I like it better."
20345,daenerysAnd you believe this prophecy refers to me?
20346,"melisandreProphecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
20347,tyrionJon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
20348,daenerysYou know him?
20349,tyrionI traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
20350,"varysAnd why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
20351,melisandreAs Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
20352,daenerysHe sounds like quite a man.
20353,"melisandreSummon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
20354,"tyrionI can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
20355,"tyrionIf he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
20356,daenerysVery well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
20357,sansaDo you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
20358,jonRead the last bit.
20359,"sansaAll dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
20360,jonIt's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
20361,"sansaTyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
20362,"davosSounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
20363,jonWhat?
20364,"davosFire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
20365,sansaYou're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
20366,"davosNo, too dangerous."
20367,jonBut?
20368,"davosBut if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
20369,"cerseiIf the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
20370,"cerseiYou all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
20371,"cerseiIt is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
20372,"randyllShe has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?"
20373,"qyburnWe are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
20374,jaimeLord Tarley.
20375,"randyllSer, Jaime. I believe you know my son."
20376,"dickonSer, Jaime."
20377,"jaimeRickon, isn't it?"
20378,dickonDickon.
20379,jaimeThat's it.
20380,jaimeThank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
20381,"randyllIf my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
20382,jaimeDo you ride for Hornhill today?
20383,randyllI have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
20384,jaimeAnd what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
20385,"randyllIt's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
20386,jaimeI want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
20387,randyllIncluding Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
20388,"jaimeYou swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
20389,randyllI've known Olenna since I was a child.
20390,"jaimeShe was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
20391,jaimeWhen the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
20392,marwynThe infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
20393,jorahHow long?
20394,"marwynIt will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."
20395,jorahBut how long 'till...
20396,"marwynYour mind? Six months, maybe fewer."
20397,"samPardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
20398,marwynDoes this look like a baby to you?
20399,samNo.
20400,marwynHave you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
20401,marwynMaester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
20402,"marwynThis is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
20403,"marwynCome, Samwell."
20404,"samShould we send word to your family, Ser..."
20405,jorahJorah. Jorah Mormont.
20406,samMormont?
20407,jorahThere's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
20408,"qyburnHave you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
20409,"cerseiNo, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
20410,qyburnCurious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
20411,cerseiThey were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
20412,"qyburnBalerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
20413,"qyburnApparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
20414,"qyburnThe finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever."
20415,"yaraIf you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."
20416,"tyrionIf we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
20417,"ellariaIt's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
20418,tyrionI know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
20419,ellariaShe was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
20420,daenerysThat's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
20421,daenerysI am not here to be queen of the ashes.
20422,"olennaThat's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
20423,"daenerysI'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
20424,olennaThen how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
20425,daenerysWe will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
20426,tyrionBut we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
20427,"tyrionCersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
20428,elliaAnd I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
20429,tyrionYou are.
20430,tyrionLady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
20431,tyrionThe Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
20432,"olennaSo, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
20433,tyrionThe unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
20434,daenerysDo I have your support?
20435,yaraYou have mine.
20436,"elliaDorne is with you, Your Grace."
20437,"daenerysThank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
20438,daenerysI realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
20439,"olennaPeace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
20440,"olennaHe's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
20441,greyEnter.
20442,missandeiYou leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?
20443,greyI will see you when I return.
20444,missandeiBut you don't know when that will be.
20445,greyNo one knows.
20446,missandeiI wish you good fortune.
20447,greyMissandei --
20448,greyIt is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
20449,missandeiWhy?
20450,greyYou know why.
20451,missandeiI don't.
20452,greyYou are my weakness.
20453,missandeiThat's what I am? Your weakness?
20454,"greyWhen Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
20455,missandeiI believe it.
20456,greyUntil I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
20457,missandeiI do too.
20458,greyNo.
20459,missandeiI want to see you. Please.
20460,marwynIt might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
20461,"samArchmaester, I wanted to --"
20462,marwynAnd this one.
20463,marwynMaester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
20464,samI wanted to ask you --
20465,"marwynIf you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
20466,marwynWhat? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
20467,samPossibly something a bit more poetic?
20468,"marwynWe're not poets, Tarley."
20469,"samArchmaester, if I could just have a moment."
20470,marwynThis is your moment. Use it wisely.
20471,samI may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
20472,marwynI'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
20473,"samOh, you are?"
20474,marwynYes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
20475,samOh.
20476,marwynThe procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
20477,samHello.
20478,jorahWhat are you doing?
20479,samYou're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
20480,"samMy name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
20481,samDrink this.
20482,jorahWhat is it?
20483,"samRum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
20484,samIf you could take off your shirt.
20485,"samIf you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
20486,jorahHave you ever done this before?
20487,"samNo. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
20488,"samShh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
20489,manThey say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
20490,manHorse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
20491,"manIf it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
20492,manAs long as we get back there before they start.
20493,manOne more round. It's a long ride.
20494,hotAry!
20495,"aryaHello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
20496,aryaMmm. This is good.
20497,hotYou think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
20498,aryaI didn't do that.
20499,hotYou've been making pies?
20500,aryaOne or two.
20501,hotI can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
20502,aryaBig lady?
20503,hotThe lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
20504,aryaShe found me.
20505,hotWhat happened to you Ary?
20506,aryaYou got any ale?
20507,hotWhere are you heading?
20508,aryaKing's Landing.
20509,hotWhy?
20510,aryaI heard Cersei's queen now.
20511,hotI heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
20512,aryaHmm.
20513,hotI can't believe someone could do that.
20514,aryaCersei would do that.
20515,hotI thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
20516,aryaWhy would I go there? The Boltons have it.
20517,hotNo. The Boltons are dead.
20518,aryaWhat?
20519,hotJon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
20520,aryaYou're lying.
20521,hotWhy would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
20522,aryaThanks for the pie.
20523,hotFriends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
20524,aryaThanks.
20525,"aryaTake care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
20526,"hotNo, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor."
20527,jonCome in.
20528,"wolkanA raven, My King, from the Citadel."
20529,jonThis message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
20530,jonI received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
20531,"jonHe's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
20532,jonLord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
20533,"jonWe need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
20534,"jonBut more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
20535,sansaHave you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
20536,jonI know that.
20537,"sansaShe is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
20538,"jonIt could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
20539,"yohnYour Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
20540,"robettWe called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
20541,"lyannaWinter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north."
20542,"jonYou all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
20543,sansaThen send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
20544,jonDaenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
20545,sansaYou're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
20546,jonI'm leaving both in good hands.
20547,sansaWhose?
20548,"jonYours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
20549,petyrI delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
20550,"petyrI was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
20551,jonYou don't belong down here.
20552,petyrForgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
20553,jonI have nothing to say to you.
20554,"petyrNot even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
20555,jonTouch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
20556,aryaNymeria?
20557,"aryaNymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
20558,aryaCome with me.
20559,aryaThat's not you.
20560,nymeriaYou can't have them all. It's not fair.
20561,obaraI'm oldest.
20562,tyeneMomma will want Cersei for herself.
20563,obaraShe's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
20564,nymeriaThe Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
20565,tyeneFather got careless. That's what Momma says.
20566,"obaraWill you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
20567,tyeneMaybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
20568,"ellariaHow can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
20569,yaraA few times. Never stayed long.
20570,ellariaA boy in every port?
20571,"yaraA boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
20572,ellariaCould we get some more?
20573,yaraI thought it wasn't for you.
20574,ellariaI'm developing a taste for it.
20575,yaraHe's not your servant.
20576,theonIt's fine.
20577,"ellariaSo, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
20578,yaraOnce I kill my uncle.
20579,"ellariaAnd what will you be, handsome?"
20580,theonWhatever my queen demands.
20581,"yaraHe'll be my advisor, my protector."
20582,"ellariaOh, I see. Your protector."
20583,ellariaSo if someone gets too close to you --
20584,yaraHe might have to intervene.
20585,ellariahold that person back.
20586,yaraUntil they've made their intentions known.
20587,ellariaWhy are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
20588,yaraStay here.
20589,yaraEuron.
20590,yaraYour mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
20591,ellariaKill us! Get it over with!
20592,euronGive your uncle a kiss.
20593,euronTheon!
20594,"euronAh, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her."
20595,endCREDITS
20596,tyrionThe bastard of Winterfell.
20597,jonThe dwarf of Casterly Rock.
20598,tyrionI believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
20599,"jonYou were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
20600,tyrionIt's been a long road. But we're both still here.
20601,tyrionI'm Tyrion Lannister.
20602,davosDavos Seaworth.
20603,tyrionand DAVOS shake hands.
20604,"tyrionAh, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20605,davosUnluckily for me.
20606,tyrionMissandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
20607,missandeiWelcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
20608,jonOf course.
20609,"missandeiPlease, this way."
20610,davosWhere are you from? I can't place the accent.
20611,missandeiI was born on the Island of Naarth.
20612,davosAh. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
20613,davosThis place has changed.
20614,"tyrionAnd Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
20615,jonShe is.
20616,tyrionDoes she miss me terribly?
20617,tyrionA sham marriage and unconsummated.
20618,jonI didn't ask --
20619,"tyrionWell, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
20620,jonShe's starting to let on.
20621,tyrionGood. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
20622,jonAs long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
20623,"tyrionA long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
20624,jonMy bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
20625,"tyrionOf course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
20626,jonTrue. But I'm not a Stark.
20627,"tyrionI'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
20628,tyrionCome. Their mother is waiting for you.
20629,varysI wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
20630,melisandreI've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
20631,varysStrange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
20632,melisandreMy time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
20633,"varysOh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
20634,"melisandreNeither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
20635,varysWhy?
20636,melisandreBecause of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
20637,varysSo where will you go?
20638,melisandreVolantis.
20639,"varysGood. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
20640,"melisandreI will return, dear spider. One last time."
20641,varysMy Lady --
20642,"melisandreI have to die in this strange country, just like you."
20643,"missandeiYou stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
20644,davosThis is Jon Snow.
20645,davosHe's King in the North.
20646,"daenerysThank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
20647,"jonThe winds were kind, Your Grace."
20648,"davosApologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
20649,daenerysForgive me --
20650,"tyrionYour Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
20651,"daenerysForgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
20652,"davosI wasn't there, Your Grace."
20653,"daenerysNo. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
20654,tyrionForever.
20655,"daenerysForever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
20656,jonI am not.
20657,"daenerysOh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
20658,jonBreak faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
20659,"daenerysMy father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
20660,jonYou're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
20661,daenerysThen why are you here?
20662,jonBecause I need your help and you need mine.
20663,daenerysDid you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
20664,jonI did.
20665,"daenerysAnd did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
20666,jonThey're hard to miss.
20667,"daenerysBut still, I need your help?"
20668,"davosNot to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
20669,tyrionAlmost.
20670,jonBut you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
20671,"daenerysStill, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
20672,"jonBecause right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
20673,daenerysYou told me you liked this man.
20674,tyrionI do.
20675,"daenerysIn the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
20676,tyrionI believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
20677,"jonYour Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
20678,"daenerysAs far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
20679,jonI am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
20680,daenerysThe dead?
20681,daenerysIs that another figure of speech?
20682,jonThe Army of the Dead is on the march.
20683,tyrionThe Army of the Dead?
20684,"jonYou don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
20685,"tyrionNo, I don't think you're either of those things."
20686,jonThe Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
20687,jonwe're finished.
20688,daenerysI was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
20689,"daenerysWe fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
20690,daenerysThey did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
20691,jonYou'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
20692,tyrionThe war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
20693,tyrionwhatever you saw beyond the wall.
20694,davosYou don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
20695,"davosBut if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
20696,"davosAll those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
20697,davosIf we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
20698,tyrionIf it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
20699,tyrionSwear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
20700,jonThere's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
20701,tyrionIt takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
20702,jonAnd why would I do that?
20703,"jonI mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
20704,"daenerysThat's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
20705,daenerysYou must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
20706,jonAm I your prisoner?
20707,daenerysNot yet.
20708,varysOur Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
20709,daenerysAnd?
20710,varysTwo or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
20711,daenerysAll of them?
20712,captainYour sister's dead?
20713,theonEuron has her.
20714,captainYou saw him take her? And you got away?
20715,theonI couldn't save her. I tried.
20716,captainYou wouldn't be here if you tried.
20717,euronThis is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
20718,"euronI have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
20719,euronOh no!
20720,euronWhat a twat.
20721,euronMy queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
20722,euronI give you --
20723,euronwhat no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
20724,cerseiYou've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
20725,euronA bit more than a true friend.
20726,cerseiAnd you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
20727,euronThere's only one reward I want.
20728,cerseiYou shall have what your heart desires --
20729,cerseiwhen the war is won.
20730,"cerseiWith Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
20731,"euronThere's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
20732,"jaimeThis same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
20733,"euronOr yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
20734,jaimeAdvice?
20735,euronDoes she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
20736,"euronShhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
20737,"cerseiI want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
20738,"cerseiThe sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
20739,cerseiIt doesn't matter now.
20740,"cerseiYour daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
20741,cerseiI imagine she is your favorite.
20742,"cerseiI know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
20743,cerseiI'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
20744,cerseiWe all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
20745,"cerseiDo you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
20746,cerseiI thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
20747,"cerseiShe's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
20748,tyeneMomma!
20749,"cerseiQyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
20750,qyburnThe Long Farewell.
20751,cerseiThat's the one.
20752,cerseiHow long does the poison take?
20753,"qyburnDifficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
20754,cerseiBut death is certain?
20755,"qyburnOh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
20756,"cerseiYour daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
20757,cerseiMake sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
20758,jaimeNo.
20759,jaimeDon't.
20760,jaimeWhat are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
20761,cerseiI am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
20762,"messengerForgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
20763,cerseiGood. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
20764,"messengerAt once, Your Grace."
20765,"tychoNo, thank you."
20766,"tychoMy condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
20767,cerseiThe Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
20768,tychoCondolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
20769,cerseiThe destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
20770,tychoIndeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
20771,cerseiThe Iron Bank wants its gold back.
20772,"tychoYour father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
20773,cerseiAnd we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
20774,tychoYour wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
20775,cerseiAnd the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
20776,tychoWe don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
20777,cerseiThat's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20778,tychoEuron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20779,cerseiEuron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
20780,tychoFor now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
20781,"cerseiHer dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
20782,"tychoThe slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
20783,cerseiFrom what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
20784,cerseiThe Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
20785,tychoYour father's daughter indeed.
20786,cerseiGive me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
20787,tyrionI came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
20788,jonI'm a prisoner on this island.
20789,"tyrionI wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
20790,jonExcept to my ship. They took my ship.
20791,tyrionI wouldn't say we took your ship.
20792,jonI'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
20793,"tyrionWhy don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
20794,jonIt's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
20795,jonYou probably don't believe me.
20796,tyrionI do actually.
20797,jonYou didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
20798,"tyrionIt was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
20799,jonHow do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
20800,tyrionGood question.
20801,jonI know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
20802,"tyrionPeople's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
20803,jonI need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
20804,tyrionIt seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
20805,"jonEveryone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
20806,"tyrionChildren are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
20807,tyrionSo do you have anything reasonable to ask?
20808,jonWhat do you mean?
20809,tyrionMaybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
20810,daenerysDragonglass?
20811,"tyrionYes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
20812,daenerysWhy are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
20813,"tyrionWhich is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
20814,daenerysAnd what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
20815,"tyrionApparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
20816,daenerysAnd what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
20817,"tyrionI'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
20818,daenerysWhich wise man said this?
20819,tyrionI don't remember.
20820,daenerysAre you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
20821,"tyrionI would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
20822,daenerysWhat was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
20823,tyrionYou must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
20824,jonAmazing thing to see.
20825,daenerysI named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
20826,daenerysYou lost two brothers as well?
20827,daenerysPeople thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
20828,jonYou've been talking to Tyrion?
20829,daenerysHe is my Hand.
20830,jonHe enjoys talking.
20831,daenerysWe all enjoy what we're good at.
20832,jonI don't.
20833,daenerysYou know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
20834,jonI never expected that you would.
20835,daenerysAnd I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
20836,jonI haven't either.
20837,daenerysI will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
20838,jonThank you.
20839,jonSo you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
20840,"daenerysYou better get to work, Jon Snow."
20841,sansaHow much do we have?
20842,"wolkan4,000 bushels, My Lady."
20843,sansaWhat does that mean?
20844,"yohnFor the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
20845,sansaWhat's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
20846,wolkanI'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
20847,"sansaYou're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
20848,"wolkanNo, My Lady, most likely not."
20849,"sansaWe must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
20850,"yohnVery wise, My Lady."
20851,"sansaMaester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
20852,sansaAre they covering those breastplates in leather?
20853,"yohnNo, My Lady."
20854,"sansaWell, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
20855,"yohnThey should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
20856,"yohnYou there, why isn't there leather on these?"
20857,petyrCommand suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
20858,sansaSo they should be.
20859,petyrI know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
20860,sansaYou don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
20861,petyrI only meant to say --
20862,"sansaThat the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
20863,"petyrOne of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
20864,"petyrDon't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
20865,"guardLady Sansa, at the gate."
20866,"branHello, Sansa."
20867,sansaI wish Jon was here.
20868,branYes. I need to speak to him.
20869,sansaYour father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
20870,branI can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
20871,sansaI don't know what that means.
20872,branIt's difficult to explain.
20873,"sansaTry, please, for me."
20874,"branIt means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
20875,sansaHow do you know all of this?
20876,branThe three-eyed raven taught me.
20877,sansaI thought you were the three-eyed raven.
20878,branI told you it's difficult to explain.
20879,sansaBran --
20880,branI'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
20881,"sansaI have to go back inside, Bran."
20882,branI'll stay a bit longer.
20883,marwynHmm.
20884,marwynHmm. Does it hurt?
20885,jorahA bit. Less than before.
20886,marwynThe infection no longer appears to be active.
20887,marwynUnusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
20888,jorahI don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
20889,jorahAnd the climate.
20890,"marwynThe climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
20891,"marwynTarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
20892,jorahHow bad is it?
20893,samI suppose I'll find out this evening.
20894,samWhere will you go?
20895,jorahI surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
20896,jorahI owe my life to her and you.
20897,samYour father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
20898,jorahPerhaps our paths will cross again?
20899,samI hope they do.
20900,marwynYou treated him?
20901,samYes.
20902,marwynWho told you to treat him?
20903,samNo one.
20904,marwynWho forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
20905,samI seem to remember you.
20906,marwynBut you treated him anyway?
20907,samI did.
20908,"marwynI forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
20909,samI read the books and followed the instructions.
20910,marwynThat man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
20911,"samThank you, Archmaester."
20912,marwynCome here.
20913,marwynAll these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
20914,marwynYou were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
20915,daenerysWe need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
20916,"varysYour Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
20917,daenerysI'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
20918,tyrionBut you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
20919,"daenerysI wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
20920,missandeiThey can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
20921,tyrionIt's too great a risk. You're too important.
20922,daenerysWhat about Casterly Rock?
20923,varysThe Unsullied will be there soon.
20924,missandeiAnd what will they face?
20925,varysA difficult situation. They know we're coming.
20926,tyrionYes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
20927,tyrionNo one has ever taken the rock.
20928,"tyrionThe Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
20929,tyrionThey will be ready.
20930,manDraw! Loose!
20931,tyrionThe gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
20932,tyrionThe fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
20933,"tyrionInteresting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
20934,tyrionIt was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
20935,"tyrionNo better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
20936,"tyrionAs a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
20937,tyrionAnd so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
20938,"tyrionBut as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
20939,unsulliedThere are none left.
20940,greyThere are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
20941,greyWhere are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
20942,olennaIt's done?
20943,jaimeIt is.
20944,olennaAnd now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
20945,jaimeI suppose as well as can be expected.
20946,olennaIt was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
20947,"jaimeThe truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
20948,olennaSo you'll just let them take it?
20949,"jaimeFor now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
20950,"olennaAnd you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
20951,jaimeAs Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
20952,olennaYes. You must be very wise by now.
20953,jaimeMy father always said I was a slow learner.
20954,"olennaIf he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
20955,"olennaThat was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
20956,jaimeWidow's Wail.
20957,"olennaHe really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
20958,"jaimeTo you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
20959,olennaYou love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
20960,"jaimePossibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
20961,olennaWhat better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
20962,"jaimeYes, it has."
20963,olennaShe's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
20964,jaimeI think we're done here.
20965,olennaHow will it happen?
20966,jaimeCersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
20967,olennaWill there be pain?
20968,jaimeNo. I made sure of that.
20969,olennaThat's good.
20970,"olennaI'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
20971,endCREDITS
20972,jaimeHalt that wagon!
20973,jaimeopens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
20974,bronnYou just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
20975,jaimeI'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
20976,bronnThere is no more High Septon.
20977,"jaimeNo, there isn't, is there?"
20978,bronnThere is still the question of my prize.
20979,jaimeis putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
20980,jaimeThat's a lot of money I just gave you.
20981,bronnIt's not a castle.
20982,bronnturns and points to Highgarden.
20983,bronnHow about that one? It's available.
20984,jaimeYou don't want Highgarden.
20985,bronnI beg to differ.
20986,"jaimeWe're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
20987,"bronnOh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
20988,jaimepounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
20989,jaimeThey're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
20990,bronnRight. Just not to me.
20991,"jaimeBronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
20992,"bronnYes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
20993,jaimeStranger things have happened.
20994,bronnLike what?
20995,randyllTARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
20996,"randyllThe granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
20997,jaimeThe current harvest?
20998,dickonWe have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
20999,jaimelooks over to BRONN.
21000,"jaimeSer Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21001,bronnI'm not much for shoveling weight.
21002,"jaimeNo, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21003,randyllMy Lord.
21004,dickonMy Lord.
21005,randyllDICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
21006,cerseiand TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
21007,"tychoI must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21008,"cerseiYou're too kind, My Lord."
21009,"tychoI am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
21010,cerseiIs on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21011,tychoSome at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21012,cerseiWe must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21013,tychoYes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21014,cerseiMy only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21015,tychoI see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21016,"cerseiIt will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21017,tychoI know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21018,cerseiThat's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21019,"tychoRest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21020,branis sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
21021,petyrThis is for you.
21022,petyrflips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
21023,"petyrThe last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21024,"branreaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
21025,"petyrThe other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21026,branDo you know who this belonged to?
21027,"petyrNo. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21028,petyrhands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
21029,"petyrTo go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21030,branChaos is a ladder.
21031,branis staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.
21032,"petyrI'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
21033,petyrstands up to leave.
21034,branI'm not Lord Stark.
21035,petyrbows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
21036,meeranotices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
21037,meeraWhat's that?
21038,branMaester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21039,meeraIt's a very good idea.
21040,branYou're leaving?
21041,"meeraI don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore."
21042,"branNo, I don't."
21043,meeraThat's all you've got to say?
21044,branThank you.
21045,meeraThank you?
21046,branFor helping me.
21047,meeraMy brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
21048,"branI'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
21049,meerabegins to cry.
21050,meeraYou died in that cave.
21051,"meeraturns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
21052,aryaapproaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
21053,"manHey, oh. Where are you going?"
21054,aryaIn there. I live here.
21055,manFuck off.
21056,aryaI'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
21057,manArya Stark is dead.
21058,aryaSend for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
21059,manThere's no Rodrick here.
21060,manMaester's name is Wolkan.
21061,"aryaGo ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
21062,manHe's a thousand miles away.
21063,"manIt's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off."
21064,manMm-hmm.
21065,aryaIf Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21066,"manThe Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
21067,aryaWhich Lady Stark?
21068,manYou tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
21069,aryaTell Sansa her sister is home.
21070,"manLady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off."
21071,man1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
21072,"aryaI'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
21073,aryakeeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
21074,manYou sit there. Right there. Don't move.
21075,manGo tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.
21076,aryais glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
21077,manYou tell her.
21078,manI'm not.
21079,manBecause if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
21080,manWe told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
21081,sansasighs.
21082,"manWhen we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."
21083,manShe comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
21084,"manDon't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."
21085,sansaYou don't have to. I know where she is.
21086,aryais standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
21087,aryaDo I have to call you Lady Stark now?
21088,sansahesitates for a moment.
21089,sansaYes.
21090,sansabegins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
21091,sansaYou shouldn't have run from the guards.
21092,aryaI didn't run. You need better guards.
21093,sansasmirks at ARYA.
21094,"aryaIt suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
21095,"sansaHe did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
21096,aryaThat doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21097,sansaEveryone who knew his face is dead.
21098,aryaWe're not.
21099,aryaturns to face SANSA.
21100,aryaThey say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
21101,sansaI wish I had.
21102,aryaMe too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
21103,sansaYour list?
21104,aryaOf people I'm going to kill.
21105,sansabegins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
21106,sansaHow did you get back to Winterfell?
21107,aryaIt's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
21108,sansaYes. It's not a very pleasant one.
21109,"aryaMine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
21110,"sansaNo, they're not."
21111,"sansaArya, Bran's home too."
21112,aryasmiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
21113,branis sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
21114,branYou came home.
21115,aryasteps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
21116,branI saw you at the crossroads.
21117,aryaYou saw me?
21118,branI see quite a lot now.
21119,sansaBran has visions.
21120,branI thought you might go to King's Landing.
21121,aryaSo did I.
21122,sansaWhy would you go back there?
21123,branCersei is on her list of names.
21124,aryastares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
21125,sansaWho else is on your list?
21126,aryaMost of them are dead already.
21127,branproduces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
21128,aryaWhere did you get this?
21129,branLittlefinger gave it to me.
21130,"aryaLittlefinger, he's here?"
21131,aryaturns to look at SANSA.
21132,sansaHe's declared for House Stark.
21133,sansasteps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
21134,sansaWhy would he give you a dagger?
21135,branHe thought I'd want it.
21136,sansaWhy?
21137,branBecause it was meant to kill me.
21138,sansaThe cutthroat after your fall?
21139,aryaWhy would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21140,branSomeone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21141,sansaHe's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
21142,branIt doesn't matter.
21143,sansaWhat do you mean it doesn't matter?
21144,branI don't want it.
21145,branholds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.
21146,aryaAre you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
21147,branIt's wasted on a cripple.
21148,aryalooks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
21149,aryais pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
21150,podrickCatelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.
21151,brienneI did next to nothing.
21152,"podrickYou're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
21153,brienneI'm not a --
21154,briennepauses for a moment.
21155,"brienneThank you, Podrick."
21156,daenerysand MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
21157,"missandeiYour Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
21158,daenerysSoon. They will come back to me.
21159,missandeiHe better.
21160,daenerysstops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
21161,daenerysWhat happened?
21162,missandeibegins smirking.
21163,missandeiMany things.
21164,daenerysMany things?
21165,jonYour Grace.
21166,daeneryslooks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
21167,daenerysIt's all right.
21168,daenerysdescends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
21169,jonI wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
21170,jonleads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
21171,"jonSo this is it, all we'll ever need."
21172,daenerysis looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
21173,"jonThere is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
21174,jonand DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
21175,jonThe Children of the Forest made these.
21176,daenerysWhen?
21177,jonA very long time ago.
21178,daenerysThey were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
21179,jonNo.
21180,daenerysstops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
21181,jonThey were here together the Children and the First Men.
21182,daenerysDoing what? Fighting each other?
21183,jontakes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
21184,"daenerysThey fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21185,jonand DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
21186,jonBecause the enemy is real. It's always been real.
21187,daenerysturns to look at JON.
21188,daenerysAnd you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21189,"jonNo, I don't think I can."
21190,daeneryssteps forward closer to JON.
21191,daenerysI will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21192,"jonMy people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21193,daeneryssteps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
21194,daenerysThey will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21195,"jonand DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
21196,daenerysWhat is it?
21197,tyrionWe took Casterly Rock.
21198,daenerysThat's very good to hear.
21199,tyrionand VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
21200,daenerysIsn't it?
21201,davosYou'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
21202,daenerysYou will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21203,tyrionWe still have the largest army.
21204,daenerysWho won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21205,tyrionCall Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
21206,"daenerysstops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
21207,"daenerysThe right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21208,tyrionIf I've underestimated our enemies --
21209,"daenerysOur enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21210,daenerysbegins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
21211,daenerysEnough with the clever plans.
21212,daenerysturns back and looks at TYRION.
21213,daenerysI have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21214,tyrionWe've discussed this.
21215,daenerysMy enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21216,tyrionA smart one.
21217,daeneryslooks over to JON SNOW.
21218,daenerysWhat do you think I should do?
21219,jonI would never presume to --
21220,daenerysI'm at war. I'm losing.
21221,daenerysbegins walking close to JON.
21222,jonlooks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
21223,jonI never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21224,jonglances back towards the dragons.
21225,"jonBut if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
21226,daeneryslooks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
21227,brienneand PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
21228,brienneDon't lunge.
21229,podrickpushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
21230,brienneDon't go where your enemy leads you.
21231,aryais watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
21232,brienneUp.
21233,briennebegins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
21234,brienneAnd don't --
21235,aryaDon't fight someone like her in the first place.
21236,podrickstands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
21237,brienneNice sword. Very nice dagger.
21238,aryalooks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
21239,sansaand BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
21240,sansaIf they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
21241,sansasees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
21242,aryaIt's been awhile since I've trained.
21243,"brienneI can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21244,aryaHe didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
21245,briennechuckles.
21246,"aryaYou swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21247,briennenods her head in agreement.
21248,"brienneMove aside, Podrick."
21249,"podrickbacks away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
21250,"brienneYou can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
21251,aryaI won't cut you. Don't worry.
21252,briennesmirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
21253,brienneI'll try not to.
21254,"briennestrikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
21255,brienneWho taught you to do that?
21256,aryaNo one.
21257,aryacollects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
21258,jonand DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
21259,davosWhat do you think of her?
21260,jonWho?
21261,davossighs
21262,davosI believe you know of whom I speak.
21263,jonI think she has a good heart.
21264,davosA good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
21265,"jonThere's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
21266,davosFewer.
21267,jonWhat?
21268,davosand JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
21269,"davosSpeaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
21270,missandeiturns to looks at DAVOS and JON.
21271,"missandeiSer Davos, Lord Snow."
21272,"davosKing Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?"
21273,jonIt doesn't matter.
21274,"missandeiForgive me, but may I ask a question?"
21275,jonOf course.
21276,"missandeiYour name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
21277,jonI'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
21278,davosIs the custom different in Naarth?
21279,missandeiWe don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21280,davosThe sounds liberating.
21281,jonWhy did you leave your homeland?
21282,missandeiI was stolen away by slavers.
21283,jonI'm sorry.
21284,"davosIf I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
21285,missandeiShe bought me from my master and set me free.
21286,"davosThat was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
21287,missandeiI serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
21288,jonAnd if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
21289,missandeiThen she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21290,jonYou believe that?
21291,"missandeiI know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."
21292,davosYou'll forgive me if I switch sides.
21293,jonnotices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
21294,jonIs that a Greyjoy ship?
21295,"theonGREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
21296,theonJon. I didn't know you were here.
21297,theonsteps closer to JON.
21298,"theonSansa, is she all right?"
21299,jongrabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
21300,jonWhat you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
21301,jonreleases THEON.
21302,davosWe heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
21303,theonI should be.
21304,davosYour sister?
21305,theonEuron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
21306,jonThe queen is gone.
21307,theonWhere did she go?
21308,randyllAll of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
21309,jaimeGood.
21310,"randyllWe need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
21311,jaimeWe are stretched a bit thin.
21312,"randyllWith your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
21313,jaimeLet's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
21314,"randyllis clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."
21315,dickonSer Jaime.
21316,jaimeRickon.
21317,dickonDickon.
21318,bronnopenly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
21319,jaimeI hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
21320,dickonnods his head in agreement.
21321,jaimeAnd?
21322,dickonIt was glorious.
21323,bronnCome on. Your father's not here.
21324,dickonAll my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.
21325,jaimeThey didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
21326,dickonI didn't expect it to smell like that.
21327,bronnMen shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
21328,jaimelooks over at BRONN
21329,"bronnWell, I learned it when I was 5."
21330,bronnpauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
21331,jaimeWhat?
21332,bronnListen.
21333,jaimeSpears and shields! Spears and shields!
21334,jaimeSpears and shields!
21335,bronnIn line now!
21336,randyllis riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
21337,"randyllCome on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line."
21338,dickondraws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.
21339,randyllSpears armed!
21340,bronnGet back to King's Landing.
21341,jaimeI'm not abandoning my army.
21342,"bronnYou're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
21343,jaimeWe can hold them off.
21344,daenerysDracarys!
21345,drogonbreathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
21346,jaimeHold the line!
21347,jaimeArchers! Archers with me!
21348,jaimeKnock!
21349,archersKnock! Draw!
21350,drogonloops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
21351,jaimeLoose!
21352,jaimeQyburn's scorpion is over there.
21353,bronnGo get it then.
21354,jaimeI can't shoot with one hand.
21355,jaimeholds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
21356,bronnhesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
21357,jaimeCome on!
21358,bronnWhere are you?
21359,tyrionwalks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
21360,guardYour people can't fight.
21361,tyrionis watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
21362,jaimeTake cover!
21363,drogonspits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
21364,bronnCome on you fucker.
21365,daeneryscommands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
21366,"tyrionFlee, you idiot!"
21367,jaimelooks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
21368,"jaimeCome on, boy. Come on!"
21369,jaimegrabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
21370,tyrionYou fucking idiot.
21371,"jaimeis getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
21372,endCREDITS
21373,jaimeYou could have killed me.
21374,bronnWhat the fuck were you doing back there?
21375,jaimeEnding the war by killing her.
21376,bronnYou saw the dragon between you and her?
21377,bronnlooks incredulously at JAIME.
21378,bronnAnd?
21379,jaimesits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
21380,"bronnListen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
21381,"jaimeThat was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
21382,bronnYou're fucked.
21383,jaimeDon't you mean we're fucked?
21384,"bronnNo, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
21385,jaimeI have to tell Cersei.
21386,bronnpauses and looks at JAIME.
21387,bronnBest well jump back in that river.
21388,bronnstands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
21389,tyrionis walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
21390,"daenerysI know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
21391,"daenerysburn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
21392,"daenerysStep forward, My Lord."
21393,randylltakes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
21394,daenerysYou will not kneel?
21395,randyllI already have a queen.
21396,"tyrionMy sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
21397,"randyllThere are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
21398,daenerysYou will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
21399,tyrionturns to speak to DAENERYS.
21400,"tyrionPerhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
21401,randyllYou cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
21402,daenerysturns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
21403,dickonYou will have to kill me too.
21404,randyllpulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
21405,randyllStep back and shut your mouth.
21406,daenerysWho are you?
21407,randyllA stupid boy.
21408,"dickonI'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
21409,tyrionYou are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
21410,dickonlooks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
21411,dickonI will not.
21412,tyrionturns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
21413,"tyrionYour Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
21414,daenerysI meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
21415,"tyrionYour Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
21416,daenerysI'm not beheading anyone.
21417,tyrionpauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
21418,tyrionYour Grace --
21419,daeneryslooks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
21420,"daenerysLord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
21421,daeneryspauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
21422,daenerysDracarys.
21423,drogondraws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
21424,"jaimeis quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
21425,qyburnMy Lord.
21426,jaimepasses by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
21427,cerseiHow many men did we lose?
21428,jaimeWe haven't done a full counting.
21429,"cerseiIt's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
21430,jaimeshakes his head.
21431,"cerseiThey're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
21432,"jaimeI just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
21433,"cerseiSo what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
21434,cerseiturns and walks away from JAIME.
21435,cerseiMaybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
21436,jaimeHe didn't.
21437,"cerseiYou saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
21438,jaimewalks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
21439,jaimeI'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
21440,cerseiAfter all this time it still amazes me --
21441,jaimeIt was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
21442,cerseiAnd this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
21443,jaimeAfter.
21444,cerseiAnd you believed her?
21445,jaimeIf you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
21446,"cerseilooks away, then sits down."
21447,cerseiI shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
21448,"jaimeShe's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
21449,cerseiSo we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
21450,jonSNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
21451,"daenerysThey're beautiful, aren't they?"
21452,"jonThat wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
21453,"daenerysThey're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
21454,daenerysturns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
21455,jonYou weren't gone long.
21456,daenerysturns back to JON.
21457,daenerysNo.
21458,jonAnd?
21459,daenerysAnd I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
21460,jonpauses and doesn't say anything.
21461,daenerysYou're not sure how you feel about that?
21462,"jonNo, I'm not."
21463,"daenerysturns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
21464,daenerysHow many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
21465,jonThousands.
21466,daenerysWe both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
21467,jonSer Davos gets carried away.
21468,daenerysSo it was a figure of speech?
21469,jondoesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
21470,"guardThis man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
21471,daenerysHe is my friend.
21472,jorahkneels before DAENERYS.
21473,jorahYour Grace.
21474,jorahstands.
21475,"daenerysJon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
21476,jonI served with your father. He was a great man.
21477,jorahnods to JON.
21478,daenerysYou look strong. You found a cure?
21479,"jorahI wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
21480,daenerysIt would be my honor.
21481,daeneryssteps forward and hugs JORAH.
21482,brans eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
21483,branRavens. We need to send ravens.
21484,wolkannods his head to BRAN.
21485,archmaesterMARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
21486,"maesterI put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
21487,marwynI remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
21488,"maesterThe north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
21489,maesterA crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
21490,samstops working and turns around.
21491,marwynIt is a bit much. Still we ought to --
21492,samBrandon Stark --
21493,samthe crippled boy.
21494,marwynDo you know him?
21495,samI let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
21496,marwynAnd?
21497,"samSomehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
21498,maesterPerhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
21499,marwynI sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
21500,samsteps forward and clears his throat.
21501,"samEveryone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
21502,marwynIt could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
21503,maesterThat does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
21504,"samArchmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
21505,marwynWe will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
21506,samArchmaester --
21507,"marwynThat will be all, Tarley."
21508,samturns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
21509,"maesterIt brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
21510,maesterDon't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
21511,maesterIs he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
21512,marwynI'm afraid so.
21513,maesterHorrible business.
21514,marwynI don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
21515,marwyncrumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
21516,marwynRight. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
21517,varysand TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
21518,tyrionAll rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
21519,varysNot burn him alive alongside his son.
21520,"tyrionI am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
21521,varysThat's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
21522,"varysreaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
21523,"varysIt's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
21524,varysdrinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
21525,tyrionDaenerys is not her father.
21526,varysAnd she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
21527,tyrionlooks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
21528,tyrionWho is that for?
21529,varysJon Snow.
21530,tyrionDid you read it?
21531,varysIt's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
21532,tyrionpauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
21533,tyrionWhat's it say?
21534,varysNothing good.
21535,daenerysand VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
21536,jonI thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
21537,daenerysI'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
21538,jonBran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
21539,varysThe Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
21540,joninterrupts VARYS.
21541,jonI need to go home.
21542,daenerysYou said you don't have enough men.
21543,jonWe'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
21544,daenerysAnd give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
21545,tyrionPerhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
21546,jonI don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
21547,tyrionbegins walking around the table closer to JON.
21548,tyrionSo bring the dead to her.
21549,daenerysI thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
21550,tyrionWe don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
21551,davosIs that possible?
21552,jonThe first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
21553,tyrionBring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
21554,varysAnything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
21555,tyrionThe only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
21556,daenerysAnd how would you get into King's Landing.
21557,"davosI can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
21558,tyrionnods his head.
21559,"daenerysWell, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
21560,varysFair point. How do you propose to find one?
21561,jonpauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
21562,jorahWith the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
21563,daenerysturns to look at JORAH.
21564,jorahYou asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
21565,jonThe free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
21566,davosThey won't follow Ser Jorah.
21567,jonThey won't have to.
21568,davosYou can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
21569,jonI'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
21570,daenerysI haven't given you permission to leave.
21571,"jonWith respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
21572,daeneryspauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
21573,"robettThe King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
21574,"yohnThe Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
21575,"sansaYou're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
21576,sansaand ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
21577,sansaI warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
21578,aryaHe didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
21579,"sansaWell, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
21580,aryaThese are mother and father's chambers.
21581,sansaAnd?
21582,aryaNothing.
21583,sansaDon't do that.
21584,sansaturns around to face ARYA.
21585,aryaWhat?
21586,sansaSay what you mean.
21587,aryaYou always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
21588,sansadrops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
21589,sansaAre you angry with me?
21590,aryaThey were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
21591,"sansaI listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
21592,aryaTheir opinions are important to you?
21593,"sansaGlover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
21594,aryaNot if they lose their heads first.
21595,"sansaWinterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
21596,"aryaAnd if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
21597,sansaHow can you even think such a horrible thing?
21598,"aryaYou're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
21599,sansaand ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
21600,sansaI have work to do.
21601,sansaturns and walks away from ARYA.
21602,aryaMy lady.
21603,aryaexits the room.
21604,davosand TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
21605,tyrionLast time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
21606,davosLast time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
21607,tyrionturns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
21608,davosThere's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
21609,tyrionbegins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
21610,tyrionYou're not staying here?
21611,davosI've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
21612,tyrionWhat if someone takes the boat?
21613,davosThen we're fucked. Best hurry.
21614,bronnand JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
21615,jaimeWe don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
21616,bronnAll the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
21617,jaimeI seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
21618,bronnAnd here I am ready to train.
21619,jaimeWhy down here?
21620,bronnI don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
21621,jaimeToday might be the day I kill you by accident.
21622,"bronnOh, you won't be swinging it at me."
21623,bronnstops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
21624,bronnI'll leave you to it.
21625,bronnturns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
21626,tyrionI needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
21627,jaimeremains silent and stares at TYRION.
21628,"tyrionYou made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
21629,jaimeDon't talk about our father.
21630,tyrionListen to me --
21631,jaimeI once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
21632,tyrionglances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
21633,tyrionIt would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
21634,jaimeshakes his head and says nothing.
21635,"tyrionHe was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
21636,jaimeWhat do you want?
21637,tyrionDaenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
21638,jaimeYou want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
21639,tyrionI -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
21640,davosI wasn't sure I'd find you.
21641,davosI thought you might still be rowing.
21642,gendrychuckles and DAVOS smiles.
21643,"davosI looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
21644,gendryWeren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
21645,davosI haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
21646,"davoswalks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
21647,davosAnybody give you any trouble?
21648,gendryHere I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
21649,davosDon't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
21650,gendrynods.
21651,gendryYou came to get me. You want me to come with you.
21652,davosI think you need to understand --
21653,gendryI'm ready. Let's go.
21654,davosYou should know what you're heading into.
21655,gendryDon't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
21656,gendryis tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
21657,"gendryI've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
21658,davosYou might want to bring one of those swords.
21659,gendrysmiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
21660,"gendryI don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
21661,gendryremoves a giant war hammer from the wall.
21662,gendrythis I know.
21663,gendryand DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
21664,davosand GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
21665,davosKeep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
21666,gendryand DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
21667,gendryWho should I say I am?
21668,davosturns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
21669,"davosI told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
21670,guardYou there.
21671,"davosNo weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
21672,guardIs that your boat?
21673,davosIt is.
21674,gendrylooks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
21675,guardThe docks are that way.
21676,gendryThat they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
21677,davosStill five gold dragons?
21678,guardAre you joking?
21679,guardYou must be even older than you look. 15.
21680,davos15?
21681,guardApiece.
21682,davosangrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
21683,davosI can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
21684,davosturns and begins walking back to his boat.
21685,guardWhat's in the boat?
21686,davospauses and turns back to the guards.
21687,davosNot more gold.
21688,guardWine?
21689,guardMmm.
21690,guardI like wine.
21691,guardOr hams.
21692,davosCome and have a look.
21693,davosFermented crab.
21694,guardWhat?
21695,"davosFermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
21696,davosscoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
21697,davosI'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
21698,"guardOi, Dwarf!"
21699,davosquickly walks to cut the guards off.
21700,davosI really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
21701,guardThat dwarf --
21702,guardWhere did you get that scar?
21703,tyrionFish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
21704,guardWe was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
21705,davosis still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
21706,davosPerhaps there's some arrangement?
21707,guardArrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
21708,"gendrycan be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
21709,davosis looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
21710,davosThis is Gendry.
21711,tyrionHe'll do.
21712,jaimeopens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
21713,cerseiThat won't be necessary.
21714,qyburnbows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
21715,qyburnSer Jaime.
21716,qyburncloses the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
21717,jaimeWhy was QYBURN here?
21718,cerseiHe's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
21719,jaimeI met with Tyrion.
21720,cerseipauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
21721,cerseiWhat did our brother have to say?
21722,jaimeDaenerys wants to meet.
21723,cerseiTo discuss a surrender?
21724,jaimeTo discuss an armistice.
21725,cerseiShe just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
21726,jaimeBecause an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
21727,cerseismirks and looks away from JAIME.
21728,cerseiAre you going to punish him?
21729,jaimeTyrion?
21730,cerseiBronn.
21731,jaimelooks confused.
21732,cerseiHe betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
21733,jaimeYou let it happen. Why?
21734,"cerseiI've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
21735,cerseilifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
21736,jaimeWho will you say is the father?
21737,cerseiYou.
21738,jaimePeople won't like that.
21739,cerseistands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
21740,cerseiDo you remember what father used to say about people?
21741,jaimeThe lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
21742,jaimereaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
21743,cerseiNever betray me again.
21744,gendryand DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
21745,davosWe're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
21746,gendryI understand.
21747,davosHe doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
21748,gendryYou don't have to worry.
21749,"davosYou're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
21750,gendryUnderstood.
21751,davosand GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
21752,"davosBegging your pardon, Your Grace."
21753,jonstops and turns around to face DAVOS.
21754,jonYou survived King's Landing.
21755,davosYet again.
21756,"jonYour Grace, this is --"
21757,gendrysteps forward in front of DAVOS.
21758,"gendryIt's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son."
21759,jonlooks to DAVOS.
21760,davosHe was meant to keep that to himself.
21761,gendryOur fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
21762,jonI saw your father once at Winterfell.
21763,gendryI met yours in my shop.
21764,jonYou're a lot leaner.
21765,gendryYou're a lot shorter.
21766,jonstops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
21767,jonI grew up on stories about them.
21768,"gendryAll I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
21769,davosDon't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
21770,"gendryNo, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
21771,jonDo you know how to use one?
21772,gendryshakes his head.
21773,"jonWell, that's a problem."
21774,gendryI prefer a hammer.
21775,gendrylooks to DAVOS.
21776,davosHe can handle himself.
21777,jonnods.
21778,jonWe could use the help.
21779,"davosAs my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
21780,"gendryI owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
21781,davosYeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
21782,"tyrionYou may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
21783,tyrionretrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
21784,tyrionThis is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
21785,jorahIt was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
21786,tyrionsmiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
21787,tyrionTake it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
21788,jorahnods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
21789,daenerysWe should be better at saying farewell by now.
21790,"jorahYour Grace, I --"
21791,"daenerysreaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
21792,jonIf I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
21793,daeneryssmiles.
21794,daenerysBut I've grown used to him.
21795,"jonI wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
21796,daenerysnods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
21797,jonHeave!
21798,samis seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
21799,gillyDo you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
21800,samNo.
21801,"gilly15,782."
21802,samlooks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
21803,gillyGuess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
21804,samlooks away and pauses.
21805,samNone anymore.
21806,"gillyThat's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?"
21807,samIt's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
21808,gillyMeynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
21809,samisn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
21810,"samThese maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
21811,gillySteps. That number was steps.
21812,samis dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
21813,"samis walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
21814,samis loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
21815,gillyAre you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.
21816,samI'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
21817,aryais in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
21818,aryais on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
21819,"aryais walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
21820,"wolkanI found it, my Lord."
21821,wolkanhands BAELISH a raven scroll.
21822,wolkanIt took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
21823,petyrreads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
21824,petyrAre you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
21825,"wolkanYes, my Lord."
21826,petyrLady Stark thanks you for your service.
21827,"wolkanturns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents."
21828,jonand the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
21829,"tormundJON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
21830,tormundIsn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
21831,davosI've been failing at that job of late.
21832,tormundHow many queens are there now?
21833,jonTwo.
21834,tormundAnd you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
21835,jonBoth.
21836,tormundHow many men did you bring?
21837,jonlooks around the table.
21838,jonNot enough.
21839,tormundThe big woman?
21840,jonsmiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
21841,jorahWe were hoping some of your men could help.
21842,davosI'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
21843,tormundnods his head.
21844,tormundYou are.
21845,tormundturns to look at JON.
21846,tormundYou really want to go out there again?
21847,tormundYou're not the only ones.
21848,tormundMy scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
21849,jonYou're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
21850,sandorpulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
21851,tormundThey want to go beyond the Wall too.
21852,"bericWe don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming."
21853,gendryDon't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
21854,gendryThey're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
21855,jorahThoros?
21856,thorossits up from a dark corner.
21857,jorahI hardly recognized you.
21858,thorosSer Jorah Mormont --
21859,tormundturns and angrily looks at JORAH.
21860,thorosThey won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
21861,tormundYou're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
21862,jorahHe was my father.
21863,tormundHe hunted us like animals.
21864,"jorahYou returned the favor, as I recall."
21865,bericHere we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
21866,davosOur reasons aren't your reasons.
21867,bericIt doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
21868,bericstands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
21869,bericThere's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
21870,"sandorFor fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
21871,jorahDon't you want to know what we're doing?
21872,thorosIs it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
21873,jonHe's right. We're all on the same side.
21874,gendryHow can we be?
21875,jonWe're all breathing.
21876,tormundhands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.
21877,endCREDITS
21878,jonAre you all right?
21879,gendryfaces JON and grunts.
21880,jonEver been north before?
21881,gendryNever seen snow before.
21882,"tormundBeautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
21883,jonYou've never been down south.
21884,tormundI've been to Winterfell.
21885,jonThat's the north.
21886,gendryHow do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
21887,"tormundYou have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
21888,jonThere's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
21889,tormundturns to look at JON and GENDRY.
21890,tormundWe have to make due with what we've got.
21891,jonglances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
21892,tormundThis one is maybe not so smart.
21893,jonDavos says he is a strong fighter.
21894,tormundGood. That's more important than being smart.
21895,tormundlooks at JON as they continue to walk.
21896,"tormundSmart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
21897,jonShe'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
21898,"tormundYou spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
21899,"thorosAre you still mad at us, boy?"
21900,gendryYou sold me to a witch.
21901,"thorosPriestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
21902,bericWe're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
21903,"gendryI wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
21904,sandorSounds all right so far.
21905,gendryand put leeches on me.
21906,sandorWas she naked too?
21907,thorosShe needed your blood.
21908,gendryYes. Thank you. I know that.
21909,sandorsteps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
21910,sandorIt could have been worse.
21911,gendryShe wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
21912,"sandorBut they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
21913,gendryI'm not whinging.
21914,sandorYour lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
21915,sandormotions to BERIC.
21916,sandorThis one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
21917,sandorwalks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
21918,thorosGood lad.
21919,jonThe first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
21920,jorahHe was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
21921,jonI was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
21922,"jorahI can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
21923,jonI hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
21924,jorahYour father wanted to execute me.
21925,jonI heard.
21926,jorahHe was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
21927,jorahand JON glance at each other.
21928,jonI'm glad he didn't capture you.
21929,jorahMe too.
21930,jonstops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
21931,"jonYour father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
21932,jonhands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
21933,jonLord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
21934,jorahstops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
21935,jonBut you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
21936,"jorahpauses, then nods at JON."
21937,jorahHe gave it to you.
21938,jonI'm not his son.
21939,"jorahpulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
21940,jorahI brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
21941,jorahresheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
21942,jorahI forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
21943,aryaFather used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
21944,sansaI remember.
21945,"aryaOne time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
21946,aryastarts a slow clap.
21947,aryaI looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
21948,sansaturns to look at ARYA.
21949,sansaWhat?
21950,aryaretrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
21951,"aryaThat's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
21952,sansaYou don't have to read it. I remember.
21953,"aryaFather has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
21954,sansaThey forced me to do it.
21955,aryaDid they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
21956,sansaYou don't know what it was like. I was a child.
21957,aryaSo was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
21958,sansaThey told me it was the only way to save father.
21959,aryaAnd you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
21960,sansaYou were there?
21961,aryaI was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
21962,sansaAnd what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
21963,aryaI wanted to.
21964,sansaBut you didn't. Just like me.
21965,aryaI didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
21966,"sansaYou should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
21967,aryaI was training.
21968,"sansaTraining. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
21969,"aryaOh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
21970,sansaYou never would have survived what I survived.
21971,aryaI guess we'll never know.
21972,sansaWhat are you doing to do with that letter.
21973,aryaI don't know yet.
21974,sansaWho did you show it to? Where did you find it?
21975,"aryaYou're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
21976,sansaArya --
21977,aryaAre you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
21978,"sansaDo you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
21979,"aryaThe northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
21980,sansaYou're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
21981,aryaSometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
21982,aryaturns and walks away.
21983,tormundYou're the one they call the dog.
21984,sandorFuck off.
21985,tormundThey told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
21986,sandorI don't give two shits about Wildlings.
21987,sandorlooks up at TORMUND.
21988,sandorGingers I hate.
21989,tormundGingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
21990,tormundpoints and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
21991,sandorDon't point your fucking finger at me.
21992,sandorwalks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
21993,tormundDid you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
21994,sandorI didn't trip. I was pushed.
21995,tormundEver since you've been mean.
21996,sandorWill you fuck off?
21997,tormundI don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
21998,sandorstops and turns to TORMUND.
21999,sandorDo you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
22000,tormundDick?
22001,sandorCock.
22002,tormundAh. Dick. I like it.
22003,sandorI bet you do.
22004,"sandorturns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
22005,tormundNope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
22006,sandorstops and glances at TORMUND.
22007,sandorBrienne of Tarth.
22008,tormundYou know her?
22009,sandorYou're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22010,"tormundWell, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22011,sandorHow does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22012,tormundnods.
22013,tormundYou do know her.
22014,sandorWe've met.
22015,sandorand TORMUND begin walking.
22016,tormundI want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
22017,sandorHow did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22018,tormundI'm good at killing people.
22019,bericYou don't much look like him.
22020,jonWho's that?
22021,bericYour father. I suppose you favor your mother.
22022,jonYou knew him?
22023,bericOf course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
22024,jonI serve the north.
22025,bericThe north didn't raise you from the dead.
22026,jonThe lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
22027,bericHe wants you alive.
22028,jonWhy?
22029,bericI don't know.
22030,"jonThat's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22031,bericI think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22032,jonSo what are you fighting for?
22033,bericLife. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
22034,jonBut we all die.
22035,bericThe enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22036,jonI am the shield that guards the realms of men.
22037,bericMaybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
22038,jonAye. Maybe that's enough.
22039,sandorstops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
22040,sandorThat's what I saw in the fire.
22041,sandorpoints towards the mountain.
22042,sandorA mountain like an arrowhead.
22043,thorosAre you sure?
22044,sandorturns to THOROS and nods his head.
22045,sandorWe're getting close.
22046,tyrionis sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
22047,daenerysDo you know what I like about you?
22048,tyrionturns to look at DAENERYS.
22049,tyrionI honestly don't.
22050,daenerysYou're not a hero.
22051,tyrionOh. I've been heroic on occasion.
22052,daeneryswalks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
22053,tyrionI once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22054,"daenerysI don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22055,"tyrionIt's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22056,daenerysJon Snow's not in love with me.
22057,"tyrionOh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22058,bronnOil?
22059,"soldierPitch, my lord."
22060,bronnHow many barrels?
22061,"soldier500, my lord."
22062,bronnGet 500 more.
22063,"soldierYes, my lord."
22064,"bronnI still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22065,jaimeThe thrill will fade.
22066,bronnIf we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22067,jaimeGold?
22068,bronnI spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22069,jaimeFamily.
22070,"bronnNot without a cock, you don't."
22071,jaimeMaybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22072,"bronnYet, your brother--"
22073,"jaimeYes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22074,bronnI think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22075,"manArchers, stand tall!"
22076,manCover that wall!
22077,jonHow many people live here?
22078,"tyrionA million, give or take."
22079,jonThat's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22080,tyrionThere's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22081,cerseiWhy isn't she with them?
22082,"qyburnI'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22083,cerseiAnd the rest of them?
22084,qyburnThey're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22085,cerseiIncluding our brother.
22086,"qyburnYes, Your Grace."
22087,"cerseiIf anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
22088,missandeiWhy did they build it?
22089,"jorahDragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22090,"tyrionI imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22091,davosMaybe it still is.
22092,"bronnWelcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22093,bronnI've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22094,tyrionA pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22095,"podrickI never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22096,"tyrionSupporting the enemy, no less."
22097,podrickHard to blame you.
22098,tyrionCersei will anyway.
22099,podrickI'm glad you're alive.
22100,bronnCome on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22101,soldierWhat's in there?
22102,sandorFuck off.
22103,brienneI thought you were dead.
22104,sandorNot yet. You came pretty close.
22105,brienneI was only trying to protect her.
22106,sandorYou and me both.
22107,brienneShe's alive. Arya.
22108,sandorWhere?
22109,brienneWinterfell.
22110,sandorWho's protecting her if you're here?
22111,brienneThe only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22112,sandorIt won't be me.
22113,tyrionHere we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22114,"podrickIt is, my lord."
22115,"tyrionI don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22116,bronnI'm sure your new queen--
22117,tyrionYou've been thinking about our new queen.
22118,"varysAnd that would be double what now, exactly?"
22119,bronnDon't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22120,"tyrionAre you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22121,"bronnI put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22122,tyrionIt's good to see you again.
22123,"bronnYeah, you, too."
22124,"sandorAnyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22125,"bronnCome on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22126,sandorI left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22127,tyrionYou might.
22128,sandorAnd this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22129,tyrionAnd some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22130,"sandorRemember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
22131,cerseiWhere is she?
22132,tyrionShe'll be here soon.
22133,cerseiDidn't travel with you?
22134,tyrionNo.
22135,cerseiWe've been here for some time.
22136,daenerysMy apologies.
22137,tyrionWe are all facing a unique
22138,euronTheon! I have your sister
22139,tyrionI think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22140,euronThen why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22141,tyrionDo you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22142,"euronWe don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22143,jaimePerhaps you ought to sit down.
22144,euronWhy?
22145,cerseiSit down or leave.
22146,"tyrionWe are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22147,"cerseiSo instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22148,tyrionWe all know that will never happen.
22149,cerseiThen why are we here?
22150,jonThis isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22151,cerseiI imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22152,jonThis is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22153,"cerseiI don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22154,daenerysYes. That's all.
22155,cerseiThat's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22156,daenerysYour capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22157,cerseiThe word of a would-be usurper.
22158,tyrionThere is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22159,jonWe can destroy them by burning them.
22160,"jonAnd we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22161,jonThere is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22162,daenerysI didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22163,jaimeHow many?
22164,"daenerysA hundred thousand, at least."
22165,euronCan they swim?
22166,jonNo.
22167,euronGood. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22168,cerseiWhat are you talking about?
22169,"euronI've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22170,"euronI'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22171,"cerseiHe's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22172,"cerseiIn return, the King"
22173,daenerysJust the King
22174,"cerseiI would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22175,jonI am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22176,cerseiThen there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22177,brienneSer Jaime.
22178,jaimeIt's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22179,brienneWe both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22180,"jaimeYes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22181,"brienneOh, fuck loyalty!"
22182,jaimeFuck loyalty?
22183,brienneThis goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22184,jaimeAnd tell her what?
22185,davosI wish you hadn't done that.
22186,"daenerysI'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22187,jonI know!
22188,tyrionI'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
22189,jonI'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
22190,tyrionThat is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22191,davosAny ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22192,"tyrionOnly one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22193,daenerysI didn't come all this way to have my Hand
22194,tyrionI don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22195,jonI did this. I should go.
22196,tyrionShe'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
22197,tyrionYou spoke with her?
22198,"jaimeAt her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22199,"tyrionI'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22200,"jaimeI suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22201,"cerseiI shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22202,"tyrionA foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22203,"cerseiSo you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22204,tyrionI didn't know about that.
22205,"cerseiAnd now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22206,"tyrionCersei, I didn't know."
22207,cerseithe destruction of this family.
22208,tyrionI am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22209,cerseiYou killed our father
22210,"tyrionAfter he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22211,"cerseiOh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
22212,tyrionI have never been more sorry about anything.
22213,"cerseiI will not hear it, not from you."
22214,cerseiI will not hear it!
22215,"tyrionAll right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22216,"tyrionIf it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
22217,tyrionI am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22218,cerseiI will not
22219,tyrionI don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22220,cerseiIt doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22221,"tyrionIf there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22222,cerseiNot to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22223,"tyrionYes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22224,cerseiWhat did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22225,"tyrionMm, not like this."
22226,"cerseiBut eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22227,tyrionYes.
22228,cerseiWhy?
22229,tyrionBecause I think she will make the world a better place.
22230,cerseiYou said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22231,tyrionShe knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22232,cerseiThat's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22233,"cerseiThat thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22234,tyrionYou're pregnant.
22235,jonNo one is less happy about this than I am.
22236,"daenerysI know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22237,"daenerysThis place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22238,jonYou're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22239,daenerysI can't have children.
22240,jonWho told you that?
22241,daenerysThe witch who murdered my husband.
22242,jonHas it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22243,"daenerysYou were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22244,"jonSo, what now?"
22245,daenerysI can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22246,jonIt appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22247,"cerseiMy armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22248,petyrIt's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22249,"sansaNo, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22250,petyrI can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22251,"sansaThis is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22252,petyrI've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22253,sansaWhat does that have to do with anything?
22254,petyrJon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22255,sansaYou think he wants to marry her?
22256,"petyrAn alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22257,"sansaEven if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22258,"petyrYou are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22259,sansaDo you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22260,"petyrOnly by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22261,sansaThey're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22262,petyrShe's your sister
22263,sansaShe could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22264,petyrWhy did she come to Winterfell?
22265,sansaTo kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22266,petyrWhy did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22267,sansaTo provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22268,"petyrAnd after she murders you, what does she become?"
22269,sansaLady
22270,"jonIf we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22271,"daenerysAnd the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22272,"jorahPerhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22273,"jonIt's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22274,daenerysI've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22275,theonJon.
22276,theonCan I speak with you?
22277,jonAll right.
22278,"theonWhat you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22279,jonWe went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22280,"theonYou've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
22281,"jonIt's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
22282,"theonNot compared to me, you haven't."
22283,jonNo. Not compared to you.
22284,theonI always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22285,jonOur father was more of a father.
22286,theonHe was.
22287,jonAnd you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
22288,theonI did.
22289,jonBut you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
22290,theonBut the things I've done.
22291,"jonIt's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
22292,"theonWhen I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now."
22293,"jonSo, why are you still talking to me?"
22294,"harragLoad up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
22295,theonAll of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
22296,harragYour sister--
22297,theonShe's not dead.
22298,"harragShe's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
22299,theonShe's our queen
22300,harragShe's your sister
22301,theonI did. I ran from my uncle.
22302,"harragSo, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22303,theonWe're done with all that.
22304,harragWho says we are?
22305,"theonYara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
22306,"harragRun away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
22307,manHe needs to shut his mouth.
22308,manHey!
22309,"manOh, yes!"
22310,manThat's more like it.
22311,harragStay down or I'll kill you!
22312,harragI said stay down or I'll kill you!
22313,theonNot for me. For Yara!
22314,menYara!
22315,sansaHave my sister
22316,aryaAre you sure you want to do this?
22317,sansaIt's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
22318,aryaAnd what does honor demand?
22319,sansaThat I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
22320,"aryaAll right, then. Get on with it."
22321,sansaYou stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
22322,aryaMy sister asked you a question.
22323,"petyrLady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
22324,"sansaWhich charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
22325,petyrI did it to protect you.
22326,"sansaYou did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
22327,petyrWhatever your aunt
22328,sansaYou had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
22329,petyrI know of no such letter.
22330,sansaYou conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
22331,petyrI deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
22332,branYou held a knife to his throat.
22333,"branYou said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
22334,aryaYou told our mother
22335,"petyrLady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
22336,sansaProtected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
22337,"petyrIf we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
22338,"sansaSometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
22339,"petyrSansa, please."
22340,"sansaI'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
22341,petyrGive me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
22342,petyrI am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
22343,johnI think not.
22344,"petyrSansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
22345,"sansaAnd yet, you betrayed her."
22346,petyrI loved you. More than anyone.
22347,"sansaAnd yet, you betrayed me."
22348,"sansaWhen you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
22349,petyrSansa! I--
22350,jaimeOur men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
22351,manIt'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
22352,"jaimeWe don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
22353,cerseiSer Jaime.
22354,jaimeYour Grace.
22355,"cerseiMy lords, I need a moment with my brother."
22356,menYour Grace.
22357,cerseiWhat are you doing?
22358,jaimePreparing the expedition north.
22359,"cerseiExpedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
22360,jaimeYou pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
22361,cerseiI'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
22362,jaimeYou saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
22363,"cerseiI saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
22364,"jaimeThis isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
22365,cerseiAnd I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
22366,jaimeI made a promise.
22367,cerseiOur child will rule Westeros.
22368,jaimeOur child will never be born if the dead come south.
22369,"cerseiThe monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
22370,jaimeAnd then what?
22371,cerseiAnd then we rule.
22372,"jaimeWhen the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
22373,cerseiThe Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
22374,jaimeI faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
22375,cerseiHow many dragons did you see at the pit?
22376,jaimeTwo.
22377,cerseiWhat happened to the third?
22378,"jaimeFor all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
22379,"cerseiShe came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
22380,jaimeWe can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
22381,"cerseiNo, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
22382,jaimeThe Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
22383,cerseiDo you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
22384,"jaimeYou plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
22385,"cerseiAnd you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
22386,jaimeI didn't conspire with him.
22387,cerseiYou met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
22388,jaimeI pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
22389,cerseiAnd that will be treason.
22390,jaimeTreason?
22391,cerseiDisobeying your queen
22392,jaimeDoesn't matter what I'd call it.
22393,cerseiI told you no one walks away from me.
22394,"jaimeAre you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
22395,cerseiThere's one more yet to come.
22396,"jaimeGive the order, then."
22397,jaimeI don't believe you.
22398,branCome in.
22399,branSamwell Tarly.
22400,samI wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
22401,branI remember everything.
22402,branYou helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
22403,"samOh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
22404,branI became the Three-Eyed Raven.
22405,samOh! I don't know what that means.
22406,branI can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
22407,"samUm, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
22408,branHe's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?
22409,samOh.
22410,branHe needs to know the truth.
22411,samThe truth about what?
22412,branAbout himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
22413,samIt's not.
22414,branDornish bastards are named Sand.
22415,"samAt the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
22416,branAre you certain?
22417,samIt's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
22418,"rhaegarFather, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
22419,"lyannaFather, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
22420,branRobert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.
22421,branHe loved her. And she loved him.
22422,branAnd Jon - Jon's real name.
22423,lyannaHis name is Aegon.
22424,branHe's never been a bastard.
22425,bransHe needs to know. We need to tell him.
22426,aryaAre you all right?
22427,"sansaIt's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
22428,aryaYou did the right thing.
22429,sansaYou did it.
22430,aryaI'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
22431,sansaDoes that bother you?
22432,aryaI was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
22433,sansaYou would have. You're the strongest person I know.
22434,aryaI believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
22435,"sansaWell, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
22436,"aryaIn winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
22437,sansaFather
22438,aryaI miss him.
22439,"sansaMe, too."
22440,bericIt's a long way down.
22441,tormundYeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
22442,"manI can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!"
22443,manWhat is it?
22444,tormundCome on! Run! Run!
22445,tyrionYou should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
22446,"varysYou take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
22447,"tyrionBecause I have balls, and you don't."
22448,jonI warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
22449,jonLook at you.
22450,jonYou're a man.
22451,branAlmost.
22452,jonWhere's Arya?
22453,sansaLurking somewhere.
22454,"jonQueen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
22455,"daenerysThank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
22456,"sansaWinterfell is yours, Your Grace."
22457,branWe don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
22458,"branHe's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
22459,"sansaAs soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
22460,"umberWe need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
22461,umberAnd my lord.
22462,umberAnd my queen. Sorry.
22463,sansaYou'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
22464,jonWe need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
22465,"maesterAt once, Your Grace."
22466,lyannaYour Grace.
22467,lyannaBut you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.
22468,lyannaA lord? Nothing at all?
22469,jonIt's not important.
22470,lyannaNot important? We named you King in the North.
22471,manKing of the North!
22472,"jonYou did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
22473,"tyrionIf anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
22474,"tyrionI know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
22475,"sansaMay I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
22476,daenerysWhatever they want.
22477,"gendryHey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
22478,manSorry 'bout that.
22479,gendryAre these the last of the wagons?
22480,manAye.
22481,"gendryAll right, let's get it all to the forges."
22482,tyrionMy lord. My lady.
22483,royceMy lady.
22484,tyrionThe Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
22485,"sansaSo does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
22486,tyrionLast time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
22487,sansaIt had its moments.
22488,sansaApologies for leaving like that.
22489,"tyrionYes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
22490,sansaWe both survived.
22491,tyrionMany underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
22492,"tyrionI'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
22493,sansaCersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
22494,tyrionShe did.
22495,sansaAnd you believed her?
22496,tyrionShe has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
22497,sansaI used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
22498,aryaYou used to be taller.
22499,jonHow did you sneak up on me?
22500,aryaHow did you survive a knife through the heart?
22501,jonI didn't.
22502,jonYou still have it.
22503,aryaNeedle.
22504,jonHave you ever used it?
22505,aryaOnce or twice.
22506,aryaValyrian steel.
22507,jonJealous?
22508,aryaToo heavy for me.
22509,jonWhere were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
22510,"aryaShe doesn't like your queen, does she?"
22511,jonSansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
22512,aryaShe's the smartest person I've ever met.
22513,jonNow you're defending her?
22514,jonYou?
22515,aryaI'm defending our family. So is she.
22516,jonYeah. I'm her family too.
22517,aryaDon't forget that.
22518,"qyburnYour Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
22519,cerseiGood.
22520,yaraWhy don't you just get it over with and kill me?
22521,euronBut we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
22522,euronIf I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
22523,euronI've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
22524,yaraAre we in King's Landing?
22525,euronMm.
22526,yaraYou picked the losing side.
22527,euronThen I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
22528,euronBut first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
22529,"cerseiTwenty-thousand men, is it?"
22530,"harryYes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
22531,euronThey cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
22532,cerseiHorses?
22533,harryTwo thousand.
22534,cerseiAnd elephants?
22535,"harryUh, no elephants, Your Grace."
22536,cerseiThat's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
22537,"harryThey are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
22538,"cerseiIn any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
22539,"harryWe look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
22540,euronAm I most welcome here?
22541,cerseiYou are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
22542,euronGood. As a true friend and an honored guest
22543,euronI was hoping we could talk in private.
22544,cerseiAfter the war. That was our agreement.
22545,euronWars sometimes last years.
22546,"cerseiYou want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
22547,euronHow?
22548,"euronI've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
22549,cerseiYou're insolent. I've executed men for less.
22550,euronThey were lesser men.
22551,dirahI hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
22552,crayahBurnt up some of my favorite boys.
22553,"dirahArchie, was it?"
22554,crayahAnd William.
22555,dirahTall handsome William?
22556,"crayahYeah, tall handsome William."
22557,dirahThey said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
22558,bronnI am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
22559,crayahDid you?
22560,bronnNearly killed it.
22561,mareiThat's brave.
22562,crayahThat boy Eddie.
22563,dirahThe ginger?
22564,crayahThat's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
22565,dirahHow does he sleep with no eyelids?
22566,"bronnAll right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
22567,qyburnSer Bronn of the Blackwater.
22568,bronnYou're kidding me.
22569,"qyburnApologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
22570,"bronnSorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
22571,crayahYou ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
22572,qyburnPoor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
22573,bronnWhich girl?
22574,qyburnThe queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
22575,"bronnShe once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
22576,"qyburnThat was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
22577,"bronnSo, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
22578,qyburnShe has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
22579,"bronnYeah, well, good luck with that."
22580,qyburnOur queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
22581,qyburnShe has a keen sense of poetic justice.
22582,bronnThat fucking family.
22583,"qyburnWhen the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
22584,cerseiI wanted those elephants.
22585,"euronSo, how do I compare to the fat king?"
22586,cerseiYou're insulting my late husband?
22587,euronAre you offended?
22588,"cerseiRobert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
22589,euronAnd the Kingslayer?
22590,"cerseiYou enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
22591,euronLife is boring.
22592,"cerseiYou're not boring, I'll give you that."
22593,euronDo I please the queen?
22594,cerseiYou might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
22595,cerseiBut now I want to be alone.
22596,euronI'm going to put a prince in your belly.
22597,"yaraEuron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
22598,yaraWe can take our home back.
22599,theonDaenerys went north.
22600,yaraDaenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
22601,theonYou're my queen. I go where you command.
22602,yaraYou want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
22603,theonWhat is dead may never die.
22604,yaraBut kill the bastards anyway.
22605,"wolkanWelcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
22606,varysThe Karstarks.
22607,"tyrionOne of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
22608,davosCan't argue with that.
22609,"davosNot so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
22610,tyrionAnd our queen is grateful.
22611,"davosHer gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
22612,tyrionI sense that you're leading to a proposal.
22613,"davosA proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
22614,tyrionThey do make a handsome couple.
22615,varysYou overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
22616,tyrionI'm not that old.
22617,tyrionNot as old as him.
22618,tyrionOur queen respects the wisdom of age.
22619,"varysOf course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
22620,tyrionWhat is that?
22621,varysNothing lasts.
22622,daenerysYour sister doesn't like me.
22623,"jonShe doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
22624,daenerysShe doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
22625,daenerysHow many today?
22626,dothrakiOnly eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
22627,jonWhat's the matter?
22628,daenerysThe dragons are barely eating.
22629,jonWhat's wrong with them?
22630,daenerysThey don't like the North.
22631,daenerysGo on.
22632,jonI don't know how to ride a dragon.
22633,daenerysNobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
22634,jonWhat if he doesn't want me to?
22635,"daenerysThen I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
22636,jonWhat do I hold onto?
22637,daenerysWhatever you can.
22638,jonYou've completely ruined horses for me.
22639,daenerysWe could stay a thousand years-
22640,daenerysNo one would find us.
22641,jonWe'd be pretty old.
22642,jonIt's cold up here for a southern girl.
22643,daenerysSo keep your queen warm.
22644,daenerysDon't be afraid.
22645,manGendry?
22646,manHe's here.
22647,gendryIt isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
22648,"sandorYou're saying you're good, is that it?"
22649,gendryI'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
22650,sandorYou know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
22651,aryaLeave him be.
22652,sandorI heard you were here. You left me to die.
22653,aryaFirst I robbed you.
22654,"sandorYou're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
22655,aryaThat was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
22656,"gendryYeah, thanks. So have you."
22657,"gendryI mean, you look good."
22658,aryaThanks. So do you.
22659,"gendryIt's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
22660,"aryaStay close to that forge, then."
22661,"gendryIs that a command, Lady Stark?"
22662,aryaDon't call me that.
22663,"gendryAs you wish, milady."
22664,aryaHere's my wish.
22665,aryaCan you make it?
22666,gendryWhat do you need something like this for?
22667,aryaCan you make it or not?
22668,gendryYou already have a sword. What's that?
22669,gendryIt's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
22670,aryaYou don't know any other rich girls.
22671,sansaCome in.
22672,"sansaLord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
22673,"jonHouse Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
22674,"sansaI will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
22675,sansaThe King in the North.
22676,jonI told you we needed allies.
22677,sansaYou didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
22678,"jonI never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
22679,sansaAnd a Targaryen queen.
22680,"jonDo you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
22681,jonDo you have any faith in me at all?
22682,sansaYou know I do.
22683,jonShe'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
22684,"sansaNo, she's much prettier."
22685,sansaDid you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
22686,samOh!
22687,daenerysSo you're the man?
22688,"samUm. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
22689,daenerysThe one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
22690,"jorahThey could, they just wouldn't."
22691,daenerysI'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
22692,"samOh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
22693,"daenerysWell, there must be something I could give you."
22694,"samIf it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
22695,daenerysFor what crime?
22696,"samUm, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
22697,samAnd also a sword.
22698,daenerysFrom the Citadel?
22699,samFrom my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
22700,"samIt wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
22701,daenerysNot Randyll Tarly?
22702,samYou know him?
22703,daenerysI offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
22704,"samWell At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
22705,daenerysYour brother stood with your father.
22706,"samHm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
22707,daenerysOf course.
22708,samWhat are you doing out here?
22709,"branWaiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
22710,"samNo, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
22711,branI'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
22712,jonSam?
22713,"samI'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
22714,jonWere you hiding from me?
22715,samOf course not.
22716,jonWhat are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
22717,jonWhat's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
22718,samShe's good.
22719,jonLittle Sam?
22720,samDon't you know?
22721,jonKnow what?
22722,samDaenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
22723,samShe didn't tell you.
22724,jonI'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
22725,samWould you have done it?
22726,"jonWell, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
22727,samYou've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
22728,jonI wasn't a king.
22729,samBut you were. You've always been.
22730,"jonI gave up my crown, Sam."
22731,jonI bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
22732,samI'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
22733,samBran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
22734,jonWhat are you talking about?
22735,samYour mother was Lyanna Stark.
22736,"samAnd your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
22737,jonMy father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
22738,"samNo. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
22739,jonDaenerys is our queen.
22740,samShe shouldn't be.
22741,jonThat's treason.
22742,samIt's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
22743,"eddStay back, he's got blue eyes!"
22744,tormundI've always had blue eyes!
22745,bericDid you find anyone?
22746,eddThe Umber boy.
22747,bericIt's a message. From the Night King.
22748,tormundHis army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
22749,eddWe rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
22750,"tormundIf the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
22751,tormundWe just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
22752,"daenerysWhen I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
22753,daenerysWho stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
22754,daenerysHe told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
22755,daenerysYour sister pledged to send her army north.
22756,jaimeShe did.
22757,"daenerysI don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
22758,jaimeShe lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
22759,"jaimeShe has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
22760,"daenerysWe""?"
22761,jaimeI promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
22762,"tyrionYour Grace, I know my brother-"
22763,daenerysLike you knew your sister?
22764,"tyrionHe came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
22765,"daenerysPerhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
22766,"sansaYou're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
22767,"jaimeDo you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
22768,branThe things we do for love.
22769,daenerysSo why have you abandoned your house and family now?
22770,jaimeBecause this goes beyond loyalty.
22771,jaimeThis is about survival.
22772,"brienneYou don't know me well, Your Grace."
22773,"brienneBut I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
22774,"brienneWithout him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
22775,sansaYou vouch for him?
22776,brienneI do.
22777,sansaYou would fight beside him?
22778,brienneI would.
22779,"sansaI trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
22780,daenerysWhat does the Warden of the North say about it?
22781,jonWe need every man we can get.
22782,daenerysVery well.
22783,"jaimeThank you, Your Grace."
22784,"daenerysEither you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
22785,tyrionI was a fool.
22786,daenerysNot for the first time.
22787,"daenerysCersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
22788,tyrionI suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
22789,gendryDon't you have something better to do?
22790,aryaYou make my weapon yet?
22791,gendryJust as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
22792,aryaYou should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
22793,gendryIt's strong enough.
22794,"gendryIt's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
22795,aryaAre you going to be down in the crypt?
22796,"gendryNo, but-"
22797,aryaBut you're a fighter.
22798,gendryI've done my share.
22799,aryaYou've fought them?
22800,gendryI did. Some of them.
22801,aryaHow many?
22802,gendryA few. That was enough.
22803,aryaWhat are they like?
22804,gendryBad. Really bad.
22805,"aryaReally bad""?"
22806,"aryaEven a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
22807,"gendryLook, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
22808,aryaI know Death.
22809,aryaHe's got many faces.
22810,aryaI look forward to seeing this one.
22811,aryaMy weapon?
22812,gendryI'll get right on it.
22813,jaimeI'm sorry for what I did to you.
22814,branYou weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
22815,jaimeI'm not that person anymore.
22816,"branYou still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
22817,jaimeYou're not?
22818,branNo. I'm something else now.
22819,jaimeYou're not angry at me.
22820,branI'm not angry at anyone.
22821,jaimeWhy didn't you tell them?
22822,branYou won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
22823,jaimeWhat about afterwards?
22824,branHow do you know there is an afterwards?
22825,"tyrionWell, here we are."
22826,"jaimeYes, here we are."
22827,tyrionTogether again.
22828,tyrionAnd the masses rejoice.
22829,jaimeHow do they feel about their new queen?
22830,tyrionShe's your new queen too.
22831,tyrionThey remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
22832,jaimeAnd she is? Different?
22833,tyrionShe is.
22834,jaimeYou're sure about her?
22835,tyrionI am.
22836,jaimeShe didn't seem sure about you.
22837,tyrionIt's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
22838,jaimeHmm.
22839,tyrionCersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
22840,tyrionWas she lying about the baby too?
22841,"jaimeNo, that part is real."
22842,jaimeShe's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
22843,jaimeWhat?
22844,"tyrionShe never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
22845,"tyrionSo we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
22846,bothA girl's mouth around-
22847,jaimeYour cock.
22848,tyrionMy cock.
22849,tyrionAt least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
22850,tyrionMaybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
22851,brienneSer Jaime.
22852,jaimeLady Brienne.
22853,jaimeHe's come a long way.
22854,brienneHe's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
22855,jaimeI'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
22856,"brienneI am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
22857,jaimeIt is.
22858,"brienneThe rise, it should give us some advantage."
22859,"brienneIf we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
22860,"jaimeYes, I think you're right."
22861,brienneWhat are you doing?
22862,brienneI think you know.
22863,jaimeI truly don't.
22864,brienneWe have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
22865,jaimeYou want me to insult you?
22866,brienneNo!
22867,jaimeGood.
22868,"jaimeI came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
22869,brienneI better get back.
22870,"jorahForgive me, khaleesi."
22871,daenerysHave you done something to offend me?
22872,jorahMany things.
22873,daenerysLong ago and long forgiven.
22874,"jorahBut you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
22875,"daenerysWhen I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
22876,jorahYou made the right choice.
22877,daenerysI wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
22878,jorahI didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
22879,jorahBut the mind behind all those words-
22880,daenerysHe's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
22881,jorahAs have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
22882,daenerysYou're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
22883,"jorahI am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
22884,"royceThe moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
22885,sansaKeep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
22886,"daenerysLady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
22887,daenerysI thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
22888,"sansaBrienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
22889,daenerysI wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
22890,sansaTyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
22891,daenerysI didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
22892,"daenerysI asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
22893,sansaYou never should have either.
22894,daenerysI thought he knew his sister.
22895,sansaFamilies are complicated.
22896,daenerysOurs certainly have been.
22897,sansaA sad thing to have in common.
22898,"daenerysWe have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
22899,"daenerysAnd yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
22900,"sansaHe loves you, you know that."
22901,daenerysThat bothers you.
22902,sansaMen do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
22903,"daenerysAll my life, I've known one goal"
22904,sansaI should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
22905,"daenerysI'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
22906,sansaWho was the first?
22907,daenerysSomeone taller.
22908,"sansaAnd what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
22909,daenerysI take the Iron Throne.
22910,"sansaWhat about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
22911,"wolkanApologies, my lady. Your Grace."
22912,daenerysWhat is it?
22913,theonMy queen.
22914,daenerysYour sister?
22915,"theonShe only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
22916,daenerysBut why aren't you with her?
22917,"theonI want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
22918,"manMilord, we're not soldiers."
22919,"davosYou are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
22920,manThank you.
22921,"gillyWhen the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
22922,gillyThey're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
22923,womanThank you.
22924,teelaWhich way should I go?
22925,davosWhich way do you want to go?
22926,teelaAll the children will be going below when the time comes.
22927,teelaBut both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
22928,"gillyThat's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
22929,davosI'm sure a lot of people would.
22930,"teelaAll right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
22931,tormundMy little crow.
22932,jonI thought we'd lost you.
22933,tormundAlmost.
22934,jonHow did you find each other?
22935,eddWe met up at the Last Hearth.
22936,tormundThe dead got there first.
22937,jonThe Umbers?
22938,bericFighting for the Night King now.
22939,tormundWe had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
22940,jonHow long do we have?
22941,tormundBefore the sun comes up tomorrow.
22942,tormundThe big woman still here?
22943,jonThey're coming.
22944,jonWe have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
22945,jonBut there are too many of them.
22946,jonFar too many.
22947,jonOur enemy doesn't tire.
22948,jonDoesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
22949,jonWe can't beat them in a straight fight.
22950,"jaimeSo, what can we do?"
22951,jonThe Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
22952,"jaimeIf that's true, he'll never expose himself."
22953,"branYes, he will."
22954,"branHe'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
22955,samWhy? What does he want?
22956,"branAn endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
22957,"samThat's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
22958,tyrionHow will he find you?
22959,branHis mark is on me.
22960,branHe always knows where I am.
22961,"jonWe'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
22962,branNo. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
22963,sansaYou want us to use you as bait?
22964,aryaWe're not leaving you alone out there.
22965,theonHe won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
22966,davosWe'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
22967,"tyrionWhen the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
22968,daenerysSer Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
22969,"tyrionYour Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
22970,"daenerysThere are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
22971,davosThe dragons should give us an edge in the field.
22972,"jonIf they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
22973,aryaDragonfire will stop him?
22974,branI don't know. No one's ever tried.
22975,tormundWe're all going to die.
22976,tormundBut at least we die together.
22977,jonLet's get some rest.
22978,jonYour Grace.
22979,tyrionDo you need help?
22980,branNo.
22981,tyrionYou've had a strange journey.
22982,branStranger than most.
22983,tyrionI'd like to hear about it.
22984,branIt's a long story.
22985,"tyrionIf only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
22986,missandeiHello.
22987,"greyWhen Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
22988,missandeiNaath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
22989,greyThen I will take you there.
22990,missandeiMy people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
22991,greyMy people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
22992,samHave you told her yet?
22993,jonNo.
22994,samMm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
22995,eddAnd now our watch begins.
22996,jonGilly? Little Sam?
22997,samThey'll be safe down in the crypt.
22998,jonIf you want to join them.
22999,jonTo protect them.
23000,samEveryone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
23001,eddThenn.
23002,"samI've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
23003,"eddWell, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
23004,"samWell, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
23005,eddSamwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
23006,"samThink back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
23007,jonNow it's just us three.
23008,"eddLast man left, burn the rest of us."
23009,tyrionI wish Father were here.
23010,tyrionI would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
23011,jaimeThat would be something to see.
23012,"tyrionI remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
23013,jaimeMm.
23014,tyrionYou were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
23015,jaimeIt wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
23016,tyrionI was speaking in relative terms.
23017,jaimeDo you miss it?
23018,tyrionOf course I miss it.
23019,"jaimeWell, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
23020,tyrionIt's not. Things would be easier if it were.
23021,tyrionThe perils of self-betterment.
23022,jaimeOh! My lady.
23023,"brienneOh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
23024,tyrionTo contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
23025,"podrickThank you, milord."
23026,brienneI don't think that's wise.
23027,brienneThe battle might start at any moment.
23028,brienneHalf cup.
23029,tyrionAnd you?
23030,"brienneNo, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
23031,jaimeYou really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
23032,brienneAll right. Just a bit.
23033,"davosWell, what do we have here?"
23034,"tyrionSer Davos, join us."
23035,"davosNo, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
23036,davosI figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
23037,"tormundIt could be our last night in this world, you know."
23038,"brienneYes, well, I'm glad you're here."
23039,brienneHere fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
23040,tyrionWould you like a drink?
23041,tormundBrought my own.
23042,"tormundThey call you ""King Killer."""
23043,jaimeI'm sure someone does.
23044,"tormundThey call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
23045,tormundI killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
23046,"tormundWhen she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
23047,davosMaybe I will have that drink.
23048,sandorYou never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
23049,aryaGuess I've changed.
23050,aryaWhat are you doing up here?
23051,sandorWhat's it look like?
23052,"aryaNo, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
23053,"sandorI fought for you, didn't I?"
23054,"sandorOh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
23055,bericMy lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
23056,sandorWas he on your list?
23057,aryaFor a little while.
23058,bericThat's all right.
23059,bericThe Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
23060,"sandorThoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
23061,sandorWhere are you going?
23062,aryaI'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
23063,aryaThat for me?
23064,aryaThis'll work.
23065,"gendryLast time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
23066,aryaWhat did the Red Woman want with you?
23067,gendryShe wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
23068,aryaWhy your blood?
23069,gendryI'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
23070,"gendryI didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
23071,aryaWas that your first time?
23072,"gendryNo, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
23073,aryaYour first time with a woman.
23074,gendryWhat? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
23075,aryaWere you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
23076,aryaOr after?
23077,aryaYou don't remember?
23078,"gendryYes, I was."
23079,aryaOne? Two? Twenty?
23080,"gendryWell, I didn't keep count."
23081,"aryaYes, you did."
23082,gendryThree.
23083,aryaWe're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
23084,"gendryArya, I-"
23085,aryaI'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
23086,"tyrionIt's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
23087,brienneAt least we'll die with honor.
23088,tyrionI think we might live.
23089,tyrionI-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
23090,davosAll without a shred of combat ability.
23091,"tyrionMm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
23092,jaimeFabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
23093,"tyrionHear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
23094,tormundShe's not a ser? You're not a knight?
23095,brienneWomen can't be knights.
23096,tormundWhy not?
23097,brienneTradition.
23098,tormundFuck tradition.
23099,brienneI don't even want to be a knight.
23100,"tormundI'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
23101,jaimeYou don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
23102,jaimeI'll prove it.
23103,"jaimeKneel, Lady Brienne."
23104,jaimeDo you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
23105,"jaimeIn the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
23106,"jaimeIn the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
23107,"jaimeIn the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
23108,"jaimeArise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
23109,tyrionSer Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
23110,jorahWe have all we need to win this war.
23111,"lyannaI have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again."
23112,"jorahPlease, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
23113,lyannaI don't need you to remind me of that.
23114,jorahYou'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
23115,"lyannaI will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
23116,"samOh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
23117,lyannIt's all right. We're done here.
23118,"lyannaI wish you good fortune, cousin."
23119,"jorahThank you, my lady."
23120,jorahWhat have you got there?
23121,samIt's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
23122,jorahYou still have a family.
23123,"samYes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
23124,jorahI'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
23125,samI'll see you when it's through.
23126,samI hope we win.
23127,jaimeWe'd better get some rest.
23128,"tyrionNo, let's stay a bit longer."
23129,davosWe're out of wine.
23130,tyrionHow about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
23131,davosYou'll pray for a quick death.
23132,tyrionSer Brienne?
23133,tormundMm-mm.
23134,tyrionMmm.
23135,"podrickHigh in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
23136,podrickThe ones who'd been gone for so very long.
23137,podrickShe couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
23138,podrickSpun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
23139,podrickNever wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
23140,podrickNever wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
23141,daenerysWho's that?
23142,jonLyanna Stark.
23143,"daenerysMy brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
23144,jonHe didn't. He loved her.
23145,"jonThey were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
23146,jonMy name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
23147,daenerysThat's impossible.
23148,jonI wish it were.
23149,daenerysWho told you this?
23150,jonBran. He saw it.
23151,daenerysHe saw it?
23152,jonAnd Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
23153,daenerysA secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
23154,"jonIt's true, Dany. I know it is."
23155,"daenerysIf it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."

23226,"melisandreLord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!"
23227,bericClegane.
23228,womanYou must try not to worry yourself.
23229,varysAt least we're already in a crypt.
23230,"tyrionIf we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
23231,tyrionWhat? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
23232,varysAnd got your face cut in half.
23233,tyrionAnd it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
23234,sansaYou'd die. There's nothing you can do.
23235,tyrionYou might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
23236,"sansaWitty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
23237,tyrionMaybe we should have stayed married.
23238,sansaYou were the best of them.
23239,tyrionWhat a terrifying thought.
23240,sansaIt wouldn't work between us.
23241,tyrionWhy not?
23242,sansaThe Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
23243,"missandeiYes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already."
23244,theonThey lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
23245,branEverything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.
23246,branI'm going to go now.
23247,theonGo where?
23248,davosMan the walls!
23249,soldierMan the walls!

23252,lyannaGet out there! Get moving!
23253,"jaimeCome on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!"
23254,brienneCome on!
23255,soldierThey're against the wall!
23256,soldierGet more men up here!
23257,"soldierFill the gaps, quickly!"
23258,jaimeGet in there!
23259,soldierThey're climbing the walls!
23260,jaimeRelieve the archers!

23276,jaimeLook out!
23277,bericClegane! Clegane!
23278,"bericClegane! Clegane, we need you!"
23279,bericYou can't give up on us.
23280,"sandorFuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death."
23281,bericTell her that.
23282,soldierOpen the door!
23283,soldierOpen the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!
23284,sandorCome on!
23285,bericGo!
23286,bericRun!
23287,sandorWe've gotta go!
23288,melisandreThe Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.
23289,aryaI know you.
23290,melisandreAnd I know you.
23291,aryaYou said we'd meet again.
23292,melisandreAnd here we are. At the end of the world.
23293,aryaYou said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
23294,melisandreBrown eyes... green eyes... and blue eyes.
23295,melisandreWhat do we say to the God of Death?
23296,aryaNot today.
23297,theonHere they come!
23298,"theonSteady, lads."
23299,theonSteady now. Make every shot count.
23300,manOver there!
23301,manThere!
23302,jonGet off!
23303,daenerysDracarys.
23304,"tyrionCome on! Come on! No! No, no, no!"
23305,jonBran!
23306,daenerysGo!
23307,daenerysJorah!
23308,branTheon.
23309,branYou're a good man.
23310,branThank you.
23311,jorahI'm hurt.
23312,jonWe're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
23313,manTo your health.
23314,gendryHave you seen Arya?
23315,"sandorYou can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at."
23316,gendryI just want to thank her for-
23317,sandorI'm sure you do.
23318,"gendryLook, it's not about that."
23319,"sandorOf course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not."
23320,daenerysGendry.
23321,"daenerysThat's right, isn't it?"
23322,"gendryYes, Your Grace."
23323,daenerysYou're Robert Baratheon's son.
23324,daenerysYou are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
23325,gendryI didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
23326,"daenerysYes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
23327,"gendryI don't know, Your Grace."
23328,daenerysDoes anyone?
23329,daenerysI think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
23330,gendryI can't be. I'm a bastard.
23331,"daenerysNo, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
23332,davosTo Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
23333,allTo Gendry!
23334,manLord Gendry!
23335,manGendry!
23336,"manThat's easy, isn't it?"
23337,tyrionA fitting reward for a hero.
23338,"samUh, hold on."
23339,tyrionAnd a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
23340,"manCome, my lord."
23341,daenerysSee? You're not the only one who's clever.
23342,womanI have to go down and get another barrel.
23343,"jaimeWe fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
23344,"davosThe last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
23345,tyrionI'm sure you had your reasons.
23346,davosI did. I do.
23347,tyrionSo did you?
23348,"davosNever got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
23349,tyrionI don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
23350,davosAnd what if I'm not trying to be happy?
23351,"tyrionThen you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
23352,davosThank you. I feel much better.
23353,manMore ale!
23354,tyrionThis is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
23355,branIt's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
23356,tyrionYou know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
23357,branI'm not Lord of Winterfell.
23358,tyrionYou're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
23359,tyrionYou don't want it.
23360,branI don't really want anymore.
23361,tyrionI envy you.
23362,branYou shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.
23363,varysCome in.
23364,varysAnd?
23365,varysNothing?
23366,marthaShe won't eat.
23367,varysWe'll try again at supper.
23368,marthaI think they're watching me.
23369,varysWho?
23370,marthaHer soldiers.
23371,varysOf course they are. That's their job.
23372,"varysWhat have I told you, Martha?"
23373,"marthaThe greater the risk, the greater the reward."
23374,varysGo on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
23375,varysThe Northern armies?
23376,jonJust crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
23377,"varysShe hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
23378,jonShe shouldn't be alone.
23379,varysYou're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
23380,jonAren't you worried for her?
23381,"varysI'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
23382,jonWe're not much for riddles where I'm from.
23383,varysWe both know what she's about to do.
23384,jonThat's her decision to make. She is our queen.
23385,"varysMen decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
23386,jonWhat do you want?
23387,varysAll I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
23388,jonI don't want it. I never have.
23389,"varysI have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
23390,jonShe is my queen.
23391,tyrionYour Grace?
23392,tyrionThere's something you need to know.
23393,daenerysSomeone has betrayed me.
23394,tyrionYes.
23395,daenerysJon Snow.
23396,tyrionVarys.
23397,daenerysHe knows the truth about Jon.
23398,tyrionHe does.
23399,"daenerysBecause you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
23400,tyrionI'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
23401,daenerysAnd Varys?
23402,tyrionYour Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
23403,daenerysYou spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
23404,tyrionIt was a mistake.
23405,daenerysWhy do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
23406,tyrionShe trusts me.
23407,"daenerysYes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
23408,"tyrionIf I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
23409,tyrionBut it doesn't matter now.
23410,daenerysNo. It doesn't matter now.
23411,tyrionIt was me.
23412,"varysI hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
23413,"daenerysLord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
23414,daeneryssentence you to die. Dracarys.
23415,daenerysThis was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
23416,"daenerysIt's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
23417,daenerysWhat did I say would happen if you told your sister?
23418,"jonI don't want it, and that's what I told him."
23419,daenerysShe betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
23420,jonI love you. And you will always be my queen.
23421,daenerysIs that all I am to you? Your queen?
23422,"daenerysAll right, then."
23423,daenerysLet it be fear.
23424,"tyrionThe people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
23425,"daenerysIn Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
23426,tyrionThey're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
23427,daenerysThey are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
23428,tyrionWhat does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
23429,daenerysYour sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
23430,"tyrionI beg you, my queen-"
23431,daenerysBut she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
23432,"daenerysReady the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
23433,"tyrionCersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
23434,daenerysWait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
23435,daenerysYour brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
23436,daenerysIt seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
23437,guardLet them pass.
23438,guardThrough the gate.
23439,guardGet going.
23440,davosThe rearguard should be here by daybreak.
23441,tyrionShe wants to attack now.
23442,jonDaybreak at the earliest.
23443,soldierCareful with that.
23444,soldierMy lord.
23445,"tyrionDavos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
23446,"davosI'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
23447,soldierHe's always better when he's got some food in him.
23448,soldierProblem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
23449,soldierAye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
23450,soldierAy up. Where you going?
23451,aryaI'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
23452,"sandorThink about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
23453,soldierI need to go talk to my captain.
23454,"sandorGo ahead, talk to him."
23455,soldierWhere's he going?
23456,tyrionI drink to eat the skull keeper.
23457,tyrionI want to eat the skull keeper.
23458,tyrionI want to see the ...
23459,unsulliedWe speak the common tongue.
23460,tyrionAh. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
23461,unsulliedWe have orders to guard the prisoner.
23462,tyrionOrdered by whom? The queen herself?
23463,unsulliedNo.
23464,"tyrionWell, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
23465,tyrionHow did they find you?
23466,tyrionDid you consider taking it off?
23467,"jaimeCersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
23468,"tyrionAnd you're going back to her, to die with her."
23469,jaimeYou've underestimated her before.
23470,tyrionShe's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
23471,jaimeDifficult to do from here.
23472,jaimeWhen have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
23473,"tyrionTry. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
23474,"jaimeTo be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
23475,tyrionYou do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
23476,"jaimeThe child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
23477,"tyrionShe won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
23478,jaimeTwo of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
23479,tyrionThe city will fall tomorrow.
23480,"jaimeShe has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
23481,tyrionI defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
23482,"jaimeThen I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
23483,tyrionWhy?
23484,"tyrionEscape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
23485,jaimeSail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
23486,"tyrionThere won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
23487,tyrionSwear to me.
23488,jaimeYou have my word.
23489,"tyrionIf it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
23490,jaimeI'll try.
23491,"tyrionI never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
23492,jaimeYour queen will execute you for this.
23493,"tyrionIf Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
23494,"tyrionTens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
23495,jaimeYou would have.
23496,tyrionYou were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

23568,"qyburnYour Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning. The gates have been breached. The Golden Company-"
23569,cerseiOur men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.
23570,"qyburnYes, Your Grace."

23599,manMy God!
23600,euronThe Kingslayer.
23601,jaimeWe need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
23602,euronListen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.
23603,"jaimeWell, maybe for you."
23604,euronIf you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.
23605,jaimeYou're no king.
23606,"euronOh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win, I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time."
23607,"qyburnYour Grace, it isn't safe here any longer."
23608,cerseiThe Red Keep is the safest place in the city.
23609,qyburnThe Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.
23610,qyburnMaegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.
23611,euronYou fought well for a cripple.
23612,euronAnother king for you.
23613,euronBut I got you!
23614,euronI got you!
23615,euronI'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.
23616,"sandorGo home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki."
23617,sandorOr maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.
23618,aryaI'm going to kill her.
23619,sandorYou think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.
23620,sandorIt's all I care about. And look at me.
23621,sandorLook at me! You wanna be like me?
23622,"sandorYou come with me, you die here."
23623,aryaSandor.
23624,aryaThank you.

23630,"sandorYeah, that's you. That's what you've always been."
23631,cerseiYou're hurt.
23632,jaimeIt doesn't matter.
23633,cerseiYou're bleeding.
23634,owenAlanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?
23635,aryaLet go.
23636,owenHave you seen my wife?

23645,soldierFall back!

23647,aryaYou can't stay here. You have to keep moving.
23648,womanWe can't go out there.
23649,aryaYou have to.
23650,womanEveryone out there is dead.
23651,"aryaIf you stay here, you'll die. Follow me."

23659,noraTake her.
23660,aryaCome on! Come on!
23661,jaimeThis way.
23662,cerseiI want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.
23663,"cerseiDon't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die."
23664,jaimeIt's all right.
23665,cerseiPlease don't let me die.
23666,cerseiI don't want to die.
23667,jaimeJust look- Look at me. Look at me.
23668,cerseiNot like this. Not like this. Not like this.
23669,jaimeLook- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
23670,jaimeNothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
23671,tyrionI'll find you later.
23672,jonIt's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
23673,tyrionI'm going alone.
23674,"greyIn the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
23675,jonGrey Worm!
23676,jonIt's over.
23677,greyThese men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
23678,davosHow much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
23679,greyThey are breathing.
23680,"davosLook around you, friend. We won."
23681,"greyI obey my queen's commands, not yours."
23682,jonAnd what are the queen's commands?
23683,"greyKill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
23684,"davosEasy, men. Easy! Easy."
23685,davosJon. We should speak with the queen.
23686,daenerysBlood of my blood.
23687,daenerysYou kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
23688,daenerysYour tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
23689,daenerysTorgo Nudho.
23690,"daenerysYou have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
23691,daenerysUnsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
23692,daenerysBut the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
23693,"daenerysFrom Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
23694,daenerysWill you break the wheel with me?
23695,daenerysYou freed your brother. You committed treason.
23696,tyrionI freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
23697,daenerysTake him.
23698,jonWhat are you doing here?
23699,"jonHey, what happened?"
23700,aryaI came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
23701,jonShe's everyone's queen now.
23702,aryaTry telling Sansa.
23703,jonWait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
23704,aryaJon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
23705,tyrionDid you bring any wine?
23706,jonNo.
23707,"tyrionAh... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
23708,tyrionSo is there life after death?
23709,jonNot that I've seen.
23710,tyrionI should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
23711,jonYou didn't.
23712,"tyrionI did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
23713,jonI can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
23714,"tyrionIs it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
23715,tyrionShe liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
23716,"jonAnd you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
23717,tyrionUntil today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
23718,"jonYou think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
23719,"tyrionMy father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
23720,jonCersei left her no choice.
23721,"tyrionThe moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
23722,jonShe saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
23723,tyrionAnd she burned down a city for it.
23724,"jonAh, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
23725,tyrionWould you have done it?
23726,jonWhat?
23727,"tyrionYou've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
23728,jonI don't know.
23729,"tyrionYes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
23730,jonWhat's it matter what I'd do?
23731,"tyrionIt matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
23732,"tyrionWhen she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
23733,tyrionI know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
23734,jonLove is the death of duty.
23735,tyrionYou just came up with that?
23736,jonMaester Aemon said it a long time ago.
23737,"tyrionSometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
23738,tyrionIt's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
23739,jonThat's her decision. She is the queen.
23740,jonI'm sorry it came to this.
23741,tyrionAnd your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
23742,jonMy sisters will be loyal to the throne.
23743,tyrionWhy do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
23744,jonShe doesn't get to choose.
23745,tyrionNo. But you do. And you have to choose now.
23746,"daenerysWhen I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
23747,jonI saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
23748,daenerysIt was necessary.
23749,"jonNecessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
23750,daenerysI tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
23751,jonAnd Tyrion?
23752,"daenerysHe conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
23753,jonForgive him.
23754,daenerysI can't.
23755,"jonYou can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
23756,"jonPlease, Dany."
23757,daenerysWe can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
23758,jonThe world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
23759,daenerysAnd it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
23760,jonHow do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
23761,daenerysBecause I know what is good. And so do you.
23762,jonI don't.
23763,daenerysYou do. You do. You've always known.
23764,jonWhat about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
23765,daenerysThey don't get to choose.
23766,"daenerysBe with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
23767,"jonYou are my queen. Now, and always."
23768,sansaWhere's Jon?
23769,greyHe is our prisoner.
23770,sansaSo is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
23771,greyWe will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
23772,"sansaIf you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
23773,greyAnd you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
23774,yaraSome of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
23775,sansaYou swore to follow a tyrant.
23776,"yaraShe freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
23777,aryaSay another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
23778,"davosFriends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
23779,"davosIf it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
23780,greyWe do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
23781,tyrionIt's not for you to decide.
23782,greyYou are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
23783,tyrionYou're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
23784,maesterWe don't have a king or queen.
23785,tyrionYou're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
23786,"greyMake your choice, then."
23787,edmureMy lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
23788,sansaUncle? Please sit.
23789,"maesterWell, we have to choose someone."
23790,samWhy just us?
23791,"samUm- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
23792,edmureMaybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
23793,yohnI'll ask my horse.
23794,edmureI suppose you want the crown.
23795,tyrionMe? The Imp?
23796,"tyrionHalf the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
23797,tyrionCan't think of a worse choice.
23798,"davosWho, then?"
23799,tyrionI've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
23800,"tyrionWhat unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
23801,sansaBran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
23802,"tyrionGood. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
23803,"tyrionFrom now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
23804,"tyrionI know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
23805,branWhy do you think I came all this way?
23806,tyrionTo Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
23807,samAye.
23808,edmureAye.
23809,riverlandsAye.
23810,yohnAye.
23811,maesterAye.
23812,robinAye.
23813,dornishAye.
23814,yaraAye.
23815,ironbornAye.
23816,valeAye.
23817,gendryAye.
23818,"davosI'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
23819,brienneAye.
23820,"sansaI love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
23821,"tyrionAll hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
23822,allAll hail Bran the Broken!
23823,"branLord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
23824,"tyrionN- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
23825,branAnd I don't want to be king.
23826,"tyrionI don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
23827,branI choose you.
23828,greyYou cannot.
23829,"branYes, I can. I'm king."
23830,greyThis man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
23831,branHe just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
23832,greyIt is not enough.
23833,tyrionGiving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
23834,jonThere's still a Night's Watch?
23835,tyrionThe world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
23836,"tyrionYou shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
23837,jonWas it right? What I did?
23838,tyrionWhat we did.
23839,jonIt doesn't feel right.
23840,tyrionAsk me again in ten years.
23841,jonI don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
23842,tyrionI wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
23843,unsulliedAll the men have boarded.
23844,greyGood. We sail for the isle of Naath.
23845,sansaI wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
23846,"jonThe North is free, thanks to you."
23847,sansaBut they lost their king.
23848,jonNed Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
23849,"jonYou can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
23850,aryaI can't.
23851,jonYou think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
23852,aryaI'm not going back north.
23853,sansaWhere are you going?
23854,aryaWhat's west of Westeros?
23855,aryaNo one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
23856,jonYou have your Needle?
23857,aryaRight here.
23858,jonYour Grace.
23859,jonI'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
23860,branYou were exactly where you were supposed to be.
23861,tyrionThat's not- Uh-
23862,tyrionWhat's this?
23863,samA Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
23864,tyrionI suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
23865,"samOh, I wouldn't say that."
23866,"tyrionOh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."
23867,tyrionHe's not kind?
23868,samHe-
23869,tyrionHe what? What does he say about me?
23870,"samI don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
23871,tyrionYour Grace.
23872,davosYour Grace.
23873,bronnYour Grace.
23874,samYour Grace.
23875,branWe appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
23876,"tyrionYes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
23877,branAnd Drogon? Any word?
23878,"samHe was last spotted flying east, toward-"
23879,"bronnThe farther away, the better."
23880,branPerhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
23881,"tyrionAs you wish, Your Grace."
23882,brienneSer Podrick.
23883,"tyrionWe serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
23884,samLong may he reign.
23885,davosLong may he reign.
23886,brienneLong may he reign.
23887,bronnLong may he reign.
23888,tyrionThat will improve.
23889,branI'm sure it will.
23890,"tyrionSer Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
23891,"bronnIn full, my lord Hand."
23892,tyrionGood. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
23893,bronnIndeed we can.
23894,"tyrionLord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
23895,davosWe have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
23896,"bronnThe Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
23897,davosAny more.
23898,bronnYou Master of Grammar now too?
23899,"tyrionGrandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
23900,samThe Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
23901,bronnThe strong live and the weak don't.
23902,tyrionFind the best builders and set them to the task.
23903,"bronnOh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
23904,samUh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
23905,"bronnWell, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
23906,brienneI think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
23907,bronnI think that's a very presumptuous statement.
23908,tyrionI once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
23909,manThe Queen in the North!
23910,allThe Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!
