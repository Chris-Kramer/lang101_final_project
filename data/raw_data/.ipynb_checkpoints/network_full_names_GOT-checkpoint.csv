77,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,"cersei And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
78,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
79,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei What if Jon Arryn told someone?
80,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,jaime But who would he tell?
81,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei My husband.
82,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
83,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei You should be the Hand of the king.
84,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
85,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
86,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
87,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn I wonder if the old gods agree.
88,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard It's your gods with all the rules.
89,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn I am so sorry, my love."
90,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard Tell me.
91,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
92,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard Your sister. The boy …
93,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
94,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,"eddard He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after."
95,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn You can always say no, Ned."
96,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
97,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maester,maester I'm told he drinks all night.
98,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
99,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,luwin We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
100,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn In any case, candles."
101,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
102,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon,"theon It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
103,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb,robb I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
104,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon,theon Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
105,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb,"robb Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
106,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
107,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran,bran I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
108,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn How many times have I told you
109,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran,bran But he's coming right now! Down our road!
110,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn I want you to promise me
111,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran,bran I promise.

113,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran,bran What?
114,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
115,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
116,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,"eddard Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
117,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya,arya Move!

138,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,"robert One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
139,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard We both did.
140,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,"robert He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
141,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard Aye.
142,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,"robert Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
143,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard I'm not worthy of the honor.
144,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,"robert I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
145,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.

148,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,ros And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
149,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion And the other brother?
150,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,ros The queen has two brothers?
151,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
152,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,ros I hear they call him the Imp.

154,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,ros Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
155,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion Clever girl.
156,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,"ros We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."

162,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
163,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,"tyrion She has odd cravings, our sister."
164,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."

168,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,robert Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
169,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
170,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,robert She belonged with me.

173,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert,robert Not all of them.
174,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Daenerys!
175,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
176,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys,daenerys We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
177,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"viserys Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
178,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys,daenerys No.
179,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"viserys When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
180,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maid,"maid It's too hot, my lady."
181,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Where is he?
182,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
183,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"illyrio May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
184,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"viserys Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
185,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"illyrio Come forward, my dear."
186,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Where's he going?
187,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio The ceremony is over.
188,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
189,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"illyrio Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
190,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
191,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys When will they be married?
192,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
193,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Is it true they lie with their horses?
194,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
195,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys Do you take me for a fool?
196,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,illyrio I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
197,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,viserys I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
198,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys,daenerys I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
199,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"viserys So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
200,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys,daenerys I don't know.
201,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"viserys We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
202,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,sansa Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
203,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
204,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,sansa He's so handsome.
205,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,sansa When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
206,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
207,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,sansa Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
208,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
209,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,sansa You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
210,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn Sansa…
211,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,"sansa Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."

213,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon Uncle Benjen!
214,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
215,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
216,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"benjen Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
217,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon So take me with you when you go back.
218,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen Jon…
219,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,"jon Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
220,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen The Wall isn't going anywhere.
221,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon I'm ready to swear your oath.
222,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
223,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon I don't care about that.
224,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"benjen You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
225,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
226,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon What're you doing back there?
227,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
228,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
229,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,"tyrion My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
230,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,"tyrion Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
231,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
232,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,"tyrion And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
233,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
234,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion,tyrion All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
235,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
236,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
237,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"benjen Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
238,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
239,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen The two he was with are still missing.
240,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard A wildling ambush.
241,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,benjen Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.

248,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
249,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,"cersei Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"

254,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa,"sansa No, Your Grace."
255,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei And your dress. Did you make it?
256,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei Such talent. You must make something for me.
257,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
258,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn I hear the same.
259,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei,cersei Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
260,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard Your pardon.
261,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,jaime I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
262,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,"eddard Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
263,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,"jaime I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
264,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard I don't fight in tournaments.
265,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime,jaime No? Getting a little old for it?
266,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,"eddard I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."

271,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn I won't let him take you.
272,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
273,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
274,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,eddard How did he get so fat?
275,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

282,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
283,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard,"eddard She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
284,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,"catelyn Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
285,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"luwin If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
286,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
287,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"luwin The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
288,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn,catelyn He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.

The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."

Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."

I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."

430,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
431,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard Nor will I.
432,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."

436,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
437,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard She's little more than a child.
438,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.

442,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
443,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
444,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."

453,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon Until your brother killed that King.
454,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
455,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."

484,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
485,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys How old were you?
486,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
487,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys Nine?!
488,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
489,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
490,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah Yes.
491,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys Will it take three years?
492,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah No.
493,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen,benjen Welcome.
494,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
495,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,maester The boy was always sure-footed before.
496,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
497,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon,"theon Saw what, my lady?"
498,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
499,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,"rodrick Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
500,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
501,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon,"theon If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
502,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,"maester What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
503,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
504,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb I'll ride to King's Landing.
505,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
506,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb Mother, you can't."
507,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn I must.
508,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,rodrick I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
509,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
510,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,rodrick Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
511,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb What about Bran?
512,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
513,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
514,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys Finish a man?
515,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
516,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,"daenerys Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
517,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
518,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
519,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
520,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
521,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa Pardon me, Ser."
522,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor,"sandor Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
523,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
524,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor,sandor He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
525,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
526,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
527,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
528,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,mycah I'll get you!
529,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,sansa Arya!
530,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya What are you doing here? Go away.

536,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"mycah She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
537,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
538,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"mycah It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
539,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
540,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya Stop it!
541,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa Arya, stay out of this."

543,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
544,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
545,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya Nymeria!
546,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey Please don't.

548,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey Then go! Don't touch me.
549,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
550,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
551,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier It's a direwolf.
552,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier I'll check down here.
553,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier I think I heard a noise.

559,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory,jory The Lannisters found her.
560,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard Right, get back."

562,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard Back! Back to the inn. All back!
563,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya I'm sorry.
564,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard Are you hurt?

566,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya That's not what happened!
573,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya Liar!
575,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey Shut up!
576,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"

580,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,sansa I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
581,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya Liar! Liar liar liar!
582,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard Stop it! That's enough of that.

588,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
589,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard Gladly, your Grace."
590,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
591,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert I'd forgot the damned wolf.
592,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"soldier We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
593,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert So be it.
594,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei We have another wolf.
595,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert As you will.
596,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard You can't mean it.
597,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
598,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
599,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!

603,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"soldier Chained up outside, your Grace."
604,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,"cersei Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
605,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
606,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei Is this some trick?
607,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
608,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
609,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor,sandor He ran... Not very fast.

611,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
612,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jory,"jory Yes, my Lord."
613,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings,kings If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
614,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
615,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
616,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
617,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
618,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
619,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
620,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
621,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard But you just stood there and watched.
622,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
623,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
624,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
625,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard You served him well, when serving was safe."
626,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys Lord Stark.

628,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
629,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
630,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,"renly And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
631,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
632,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
633,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
634,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
635,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
636,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."

639,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard And you served another King.
640,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
641,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Without the King?
642,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,"renly Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
643,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
644,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr We are the lords of small matters here.
645,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,renly My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
646,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr Mmm, how much?"
647,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
648,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,grand Can the treasury bear such expense?
649,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
650,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
651,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
652,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard How could you let this happen?
653,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
654,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
655,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
656,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,"renly Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
657,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
658,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
659,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
660,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
661,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei Please, it's nearly healed."
662,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey It's ugly.
663,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
664,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
665,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
666,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey Do I have to marry her?
667,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
668,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey I don't want to.
669,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
670,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
671,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei How would you handle them?
672,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
673,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei A royal army?
674,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
675,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei And if the northerners rebel?
676,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
677,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
678,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey For me. I'm their King.
679,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
680,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey I'm not asking.
681,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
682,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
683,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
684,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,"septa Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
685,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya I'm practicing.
686,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa Practicing for what?
687,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya The Prince.
688,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,"septa Arya, stop!"
689,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
690,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa The Hound killed your friend.
691,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
692,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa You're an idiot.
693,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,"arya You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
694,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa Enough!
695,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard What's happening here?
696,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
697,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
698,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
699,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
700,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa You've barely eaten a thing.
701,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard It's all right. Go on.
702,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard War was easier than daughters.
703,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya Go away!
704,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
705,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya Mine.
706,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
707,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
708,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Come here. Now what do you want with this?
709,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya It's called Needle.
710,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
711,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya Stick 'em with the pointy end.
712,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard laughs] That's the essence of it.
713,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
714,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
715,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,"arya I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
716,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
717,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya So was I! He is a liar.
718,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
719,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya But how you can let her marry someone like that?
720,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
721,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya Winter is coming.
722,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
723,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya I don't hate her. Not really.
724,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
725,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya I can keep it?
726,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
727,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
728,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran I hate your stories.
729,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
730,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
731,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,"old Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
732,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb What are you telling him now?
733,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
734,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
735,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran Maybe we do.
736,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,"robb How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
737,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,"bran I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
738,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb Don't ever say that.
739,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran I'd rather be dead.
740,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick,"rodrick Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
741,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
742,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick,rodrick My Lady.
743,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
744,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn I would. We've done nothing wrong.
745,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,guard We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
746,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
747,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard Follow me, Lady Stark."
748,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
749,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
750,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
751,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
752,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
753,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
754,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr A dear friend told me.
755,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys Lady Stark.
756,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Lord Varys.
757,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
758,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn How did you know I was coming?
759,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
760,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Do you know whose dagger this is?
761,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys I must admit I do not.
762,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
763,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Yours?
764,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
765,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn To whom?
766,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
767,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,"alliser If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
768,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,alliser Next!
769,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,"alliser Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
770,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion A charming man.
771,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion Good news or bad?
775,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor Both.
776,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,grand Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard My wife is in Winterfell.
779,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr Is she?
780,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
781,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard You're a funny man. A very funny man.
782,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
783,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
784,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn You broke my nose, bastard!"
785,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon It's an improvement.
786,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,pyp I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn What're you looking at, halfman?"
789,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,rast What do you care about our faces?
791,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon They hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn We have proof. We have the blade.
799,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei How could you be so stupid?
805,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime Calm down.
806,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime Then what are you raving about?
810,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei And my husband?
813,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
814,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei Let me go.
815,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime Never.
816,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
817,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn I wish I could see the girls.
818,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard It's too dangerous.
819,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Just for a moment.
820,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Until we know who our enemies are...
821,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
822,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
823,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei And if you find the proof?
824,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
825,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
826,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard He still loves you.
827,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn Does he?
828,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard Off with you.
829,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
830,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan Of course, your Grace."
831,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert Who was it?
832,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,barristan A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
833,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert How'd you do it?
834,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,barristan Lance through the heart.
835,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,"robert Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
836,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel,"lancel It's empty, your Grace."
837,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert What do you mean it's empty?
838,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel,lancel There's no more wine.
839,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,"robert Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
840,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
841,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
842,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
843,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
844,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert Your outlaw... Any last words?
845,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime I cut his head off, so no."
846,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
847,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
848,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
849,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys From whom?
850,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
851,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys Tell them all to stop.
852,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
853,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys Until I command them otherwise.
854,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah You're learning to talk like a Queen.
855,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
856,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys,viserys You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
857,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
858,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys No!
859,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
860,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,"daenerys Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
861,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys,viserys Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
862,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
863,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo You walk. [to Viserys]
864,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
865,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon You're leaving?
866,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
867,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon What kind of reports?
868,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen The kind I don't want to believe.
869,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon m ready. I won't let you down.
870,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
871,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon But I'm better than every...
872,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
873,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren A bear's balls.
874,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion You're joking?
875,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
876,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion And how do a bear's balls taste?
877,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
878,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
879,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
880,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
881,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
882,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
883,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
884,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
885,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen Call me what you like.
886,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
887,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
888,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
889,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
890,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
891,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen Enjoy the capital, brother."
892,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren I always do.
893,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
894,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
895,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
896,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
897,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
898,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
899,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
900,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri Yes, Khaleesi."
901,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys What are you doing?
902,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
903,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
904,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
905,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah Armor.
906,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
907,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah Slow.
908,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo Slow.
909,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
910,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
911,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
912,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"rakharo He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
913,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
914,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
915,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo There are no rabbits.
916,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
917,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"rakharo Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
918,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
919,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah I don't think she wants to eat dog.
920,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
921,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo A blessing from the Great Stallion.
922,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri She does not want to eat horse.
923,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
924,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,rhakaro We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
925,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
926,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
927,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,"maester How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
928,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion Eight... no, nine."
929,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester All of them brief?
930,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
931,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
932,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,"jeor We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
933,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
934,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
935,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
936,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
937,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,"maester When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
938,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys It's a boy.
939,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,khal,khal How do you know?
940,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys I know.
941,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,"jon I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
942,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
943,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
944,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
945,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,"jon If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
946,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion Of course.

955,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,syrio It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong.

956,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya What if I drop it?
957,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."

The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."

He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
986,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,bran Will I really be able to ride?
987,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.

1275,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.

1281,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam Was she... Old and ugly?
1282,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1283,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam What color hair?

1287,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam That good?
1288,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon Better.
1289,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1290,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon What's my name?
1291,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam Jon Snow?
1292,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon And why is my surname Snow?
1293,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1294,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,"jon I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1295,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam So... You didn't know where to put it?
1296,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1297,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam It is a bit nippy.
1298,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1299,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon I build my own fires.
1300,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1301,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1302,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah,jorah Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.

1304,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah,jorah The truth now
1305,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.

1308,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah,jorah Home.
1309,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.

1324,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr,"petyr Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1325,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa,sansa I won't tell anyone. I promise.

1331,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei,cersei I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?

1368,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan,barristan No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1369,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard He'd never worn this armor before.
1370,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan,barristan Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1371,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Who determines the draw?

1379,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1380,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan,barristan Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.

1398,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

1526,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1527,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1528,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys I didn't trust you.
1529,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard So why do you trust me now?
1530,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1531,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard What sort of doom does the King face?
1532,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1533,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Who gave it to him?
1534,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1535,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1536,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1537,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1538,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Someone who could afford it.
1539,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1540,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys He started asking questions.
1541,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1542,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,"illyrio And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1543,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1544,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,"illyrio What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1545,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys This Hand is not the other.
1546,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,illyrio We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1547,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1548,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,illyrio It never was.
1549,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1550,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr You do move quietly.
1551,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys We all have our qualities.
1552,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1553,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1554,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1555,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1556,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1557,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1558,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1559,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1560,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1561,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Strictly speaking.
1562,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1563,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1564,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1565,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1566,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr Saw me with your own eyes?
1567,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Eyes I own.
1568,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1569,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1570,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr One shudders at the thought.
1571,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Oh.
1572,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1573,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Have you?
1574,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1575,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Was that you under the bed?
1576,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1577,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys Oh, please."
1578,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1579,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1580,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr To a small council meeting?
1581,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1582,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard Off with you. No begging.
1583,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1584,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1585,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya I want to see my father.
1586,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1587,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1588,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1589,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1590,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya They said they were going to kill you.
1591,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Who did?
1592,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1593,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard Oh, Arya."
1594,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1595,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Where did you hear this?
1596,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1597,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard What were you doing in the dungeons?
1598,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya Chasing a cat.
1599,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1600,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard Your name, friend?"
1601,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1602,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya I'm a girl!
1603,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Did Benjen send you?
1604,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1605,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1606,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1607,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Know what?
1608,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren Best said in private, my Lord."
1609,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Go on. We'll talk more later.
1610,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard Jory, take her safely to her room."
1611,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1612,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya How many guards does my father have?
1613,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,jory Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1614,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1615,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory No fear on that count, little Lady."
1616,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Well?
1617,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1618,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1619,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn To whom do I speak?
1620,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1621,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn There was no time to send word.
1622,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1623,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1624,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,vardis He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1625,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn My sister will decide what he looks like.
1626,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1627,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,tyrion The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1628,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,bronn Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1629,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,tyrion I like you.
1630,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1631,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I need to see the King first -- alone.
1632,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1633,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Is it about my wife?
1634,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1635,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert The whore is pregnant.
1636,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard You're speaking of murdering a child.
1637,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1638,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1639,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1640,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1641,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Careful, Ned. Careful now."
1642,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1643,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1644,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Based on whose information?
1645,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1646,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1647,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1648,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1649,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
1650,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1651,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1652,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1653,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,grand,"grand I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1654,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly We should have had them both killed years ago.
1655,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1656,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1657,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert She dies.
1658,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I will have no part in it.
1659,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1660,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1661,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1662,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1663,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1664,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1665,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard What can I do for you?
1666,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr When do you return to Winterfell?
1667,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Why? What do you care?
1668,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1669,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I don't have the time.
1670,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1671,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1672,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,jory Heward and Wyl.
1673,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Find them and meet me at the stables.
1674,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,"lysa You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1675,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,"catelyn Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1676,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1677,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin,robin Mommy? Is that the bad man?
1678,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa It is.
1679,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin,robin He's little.
1680,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1681,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,tyrion Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1682,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1683,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,"tyrion If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1684,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin,"robin You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1685,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,"lysa Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1686,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin,robin Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1687,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,"lysa Perhaps you will, my little love."
1688,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1689,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,"lysa Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1690,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mord,"mord You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1691,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1692,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1693,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras You're jealous.
1694,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Are you sure this won't hurt?
1695,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Only if I slip.
1696,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly And you prefer me like this?
1697,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Mhmm.
1698,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1699,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras I want you.
1700,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1701,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Hold still.
1702,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1703,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
1704,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1705,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
1706,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1707,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1708,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1709,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
1710,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Everywhere?
1711,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1712,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1713,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1714,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1715,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras I have an outrageous amount of money.
1716,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Not as much as the Lannisters.
1717,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras But a lot more than you.
1718,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1719,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1720,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1721,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Do you know who should be King?
1722,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Be serious.
1723,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1724,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly I'm fourth in line.
1725,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1726,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly Stannis?
1727,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1728,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly He's still my older brother.
1729,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly What are you doing?!
1730,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras Look at it.
1731,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly You cut me!
1732,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1733,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1734,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1735,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1736,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1737,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1738,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1739,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1740,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1741,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1742,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei Is my father wrong?
1743,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1744,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei We still outnumber them.
1745,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1746,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei Five.
1747,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1748,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei What do you want?
1749,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1750,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei Our marriage.
1751,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1752,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei Every day.
1753,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert How long can hate hold a thing together?
1754,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1755,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert Yes, it is."
1756,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
1757,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1758,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1759,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert So why now?
1760,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1761,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1762,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei I felt something for you once, you know?"
1763,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert I know.
1764,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1765,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1766,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei It doesn't make me feel anything.
1767,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"mhaegen She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1768,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"mhaegen Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1769,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I will.
1770,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"mhaegen And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1771,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1772,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"mhaegen He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1773,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1774,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1775,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1776,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Well, he has more than you, for a start."
1777,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard How many?
1778,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1779,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1780,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1781,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Come.
1782,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard Jory!
1783,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,jory My Lord.
1784,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,jaime Such a small pack of wolves.
1785,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1786,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,jaime Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1787,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1788,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,"jaime Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1789,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard I remember him well.
1790,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,"jaime It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1791,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1792,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1793,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,"jaime Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1794,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,jory If you threaten my Lord again...
1795,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,"jaime Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
1796,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1797,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,jaime You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1798,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime,"jaime My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1799,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,"eddard Your pardon, your Grace."
1800,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei,cersei Do you know what your wife has done?
1801,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard She did nothing I did not command.
1802,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,robert Who'd have thought she had it in her?
1803,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei,cersei By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1804,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard I am the King's Hand -
1805,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei,cersei You were the King's Hand!
1806,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard trying to keep the peace -
1807,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei,cersei You shall now be held accountable.
1808,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
1809,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard He butchered my men.

When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate.

1969,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
1970,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,renly Sounds exhilarating.
1971,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
1972,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,"renly Once, I think."
1973,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
1974,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,renly Those were some lucky girls.

1978,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,"renly What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1979,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
1980,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,renly I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
1981,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"man They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again.

1989,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1990,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand,grand Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
1991,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?

1993,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

1995,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,"eddard I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."

2003,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,"petyr A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2004,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2005,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin,robin Is it over?

2644,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb,robb What does he want in return?
2645,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn,catelyn You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2646,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb,"robb Fine, fine. And?"

2659,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon No.
2660,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2661,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,"jon He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2662,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2663,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon Sam told you.
2664,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2665,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2666,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2667,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,"jon You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2668,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,maester The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2669,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon Who are you?
2670,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2671,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon You're Aemon Targaryen.
2672,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."

2677,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,qotho He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2678,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,"daenerys He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2679,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,qotho This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2680,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2681,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"qotho You do not command me, Khaleesi."

2684,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2685,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,qotho Hyah! Hyah!
2686,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan,kevan Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2687,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin,"tywin The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2688,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2689,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin,"tywin l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2690,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan,"kevan The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2691,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Shagga likes axes.
2692,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin,"tywin When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2693,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2694,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan,kevan They do seem rather ferocious.
2695,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2696,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin,"tywin When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2697,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2698,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin,tywin There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2699,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."

2705,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn He said something.
2706,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2707,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."

And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."

2732,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,"jorah This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2733,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri The wound has festered.

2785,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Let's play a new game.
2786,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2787,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2788,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn Not if you win.
2789,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."

2791,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion l happen to be a great judge of character.
2792,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn This sounds like a boring game.
2793,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2794,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae l don't want to play this game.
2795,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2796,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn But my mother hit harder.
2797,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion You killed your first man before you were 12.
2798,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2799,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion You've been north of the Wall.
2800,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae What brought you up there?

2803,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae l don't want to play.
2804,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.

2806,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2807,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion And we've established the rules about lying?
2808,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae Drink!
2809,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2810,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2811,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2812,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion Are you sure –
2813,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2814,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2815,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae My turn.
2816,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2817,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae Who were you in love with?
2818,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion That's not how the game works.
2819,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae l don't care the way the game works.
2820,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn Our lord here used to be married.
2821,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae Married?
2822,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion How did you hear that?
2823,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2824,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Another night, perhaps."
2825,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae Not another night. This night.
2826,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion lt's not a pleasant story.
2827,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae Oh, maybe l will cry."
2828,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2829,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2830,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn For three chickens, l should hope so."
2831,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2832,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2833,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2834,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2835,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae You should have known she was a whore.
2836,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2837,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2838,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion As l said, l was young and stupid."
2839,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae You are still young and stupid.
2840,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion What is it? What do you want?
2841,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn You're sleeping through the war.

Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"

Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."

3241,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion,tyrion Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3242,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei,cersei I tried to stop it.
3243,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion,tyrion Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
3244,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei,cersei Robb Stark is a child.
3245,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion,tyrion Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3246,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei,cersei What do you know about warfare?
3247,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion,tyrion Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

3253,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion,tyrion You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.

3259,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"lord The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
3260,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,luwin Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

3267,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,lord I - I believe it will.
3268,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"luwin We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3269,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran,bran I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3270,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,luwin Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.

3279,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran,bran I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3280,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"osha Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3281,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"osha The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."

Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."

It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
4017,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,luwin All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?

4145,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae Do you want me to leave?
4146,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa Just brush my hair.
4147,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
4148,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4149,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
4150,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Please.
4151,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Thank you, my lord."
4152,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
4153,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4154,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4155,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4156,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4157,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4158,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4159,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
4160,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
4161,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
4162,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4163,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4164,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Precisely.
4165,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4166,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion But remember, you must tell no one."
4167,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr Tell no one what?
4168,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4169,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4170,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4171,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4172,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Who better?
4173,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4174,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4175,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr Harrenhal is cursed.
4176,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4177,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4178,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4179,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4180,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
4181,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Good. Oh. And remember-
4182,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr The Queen mustn't know.
4183,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly That must hurt.
4184,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly What? What is it?
4185,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
4186,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly Brienne is a very capable warrior.
4187,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
4188,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
4189,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly I'll make it up to you.
4190,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"loras No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4191,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
4192,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly And Margaery's a virgin?
4193,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
4194,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"renly I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
4195,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery As is your right. You are a king.
4196,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly You look very beautiful.
4197,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery Thank you, Your Grace."
4198,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly It's a lovely gown.
4199,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
4200,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly You certainly don't need it.
4201,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"renly Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
4202,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly Must be the wine.
4203,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery Here, let me."
4204,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly I'm sorry.
4205,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery Do you want my brother to come in and help?
4206,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly What?
4207,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
4208,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly I don't know what you're talking about.
4209,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
4210,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
4211,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
4212,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
4213,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
4214,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
4215,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Dorne is the safest place for her.
4216,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4217,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
4218,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei She'll be a hostage.
4219,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion A guest.
4220,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,"cersei You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
4221,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion It's done, Cersei."
4222,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei No.
4223,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion You cannot stop it.
4224,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei No!
4225,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
4226,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei Get out! Get out!
4227,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,priest,"priest Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
4228,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon I would.
4229,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned,drowned Kneel.
4230,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned,"drowned Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
4231,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon What is dead may never die.
4232,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned,drowned What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
4233,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
4234,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
4235,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
4236,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
4237,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr Leave me out of your next deception.
4238,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
4239,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
4240,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
4241,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Find him?
4242,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"bronn Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
4243,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion No, you don't."
4244,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"bronn No, I don't."
4245,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle What is the meaning of this?
4246,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle No, please, please."
4247,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
4248,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle I am your loyal servant.
4249,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4250,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4251,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
4252,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle The eunuch has spies everywhere.
4253,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
4254,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle No, no, no."
4255,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,timett,"timett There are no goats, halfman."
4256,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Well, make do."
4257,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion How long have you been spying for my sister?
4258,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
4259,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion I don't like his beard.
4260,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle What? What?
4261,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Oh, no. No."
4262,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
4263,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
4264,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion So you poisoned him?
4265,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle No. Never.
4266,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
4267,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Lannister, I always served Lannister."
4268,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
4269,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
4270,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion For your trouble.
4271,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,varys You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
4272,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Good. One of my better ideas.
4273,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,varys And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4274,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4275,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4276,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4277,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion Why, am I about to hear one?"
4278,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4279,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion Depends on the sellsword.
4280,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,varys Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4281,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4282,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4283,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion I've decided I don't like riddles.
4284,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
4285,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"yoren You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
4286,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya,arya I can't sleep.
4287,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya,arya I don't like the taste.
4288,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"yoren Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."

I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"

4313,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,guard I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
4314,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"rennick How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."

4366,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,talisa That should help his foot grow back.

4402,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."

4404,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
4405,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,bronn There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

4605,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4606,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4607,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4608,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4609,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4610,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel As I said several times.
4611,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4612,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4613,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4614,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4615,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4616,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4617,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel I am a knight!
4618,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4619,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4620,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4621,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel It's not my fault!
4622,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4623,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4624,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4625,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel I only meant I did as I was bid.
4626,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4627,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4628,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4629,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4630,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion No, I think not."
4631,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel My lord?
4632,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4633,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4634,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4635,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel But her demands?
4636,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4637,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel You will?
4638,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
4639,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Your Grace.
4640,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
4641,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4642,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis Fewer.
4643,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Pardon?
4644,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4645,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4646,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,"stannis You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4647,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4648,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis Does he listen?
4649,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4650,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4651,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4652,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4653,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4654,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4655,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4656,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4657,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4658,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4659,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4660,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4661,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4662,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos And which are you?
4663,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4664,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos Well, that must be very nice for you."
4665,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre Do you love your wife?
4666,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos I do.
4667,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre Yet you have known other women.
4668,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Don't talk about my wife.
4669,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4670,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre And you will.
4671,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4672,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4673,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4674,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre They can't bar our passage.
4675,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos Gods protect us.
4676,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4677,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly You swear it?
4678,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4679,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4680,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn And the wording of this oath?
4681,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4682,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn And in return for my son's loyalty?
4683,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4684,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4685,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4686,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4687,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4688,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne No! No.
4689,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier Follow me!
4690,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier You'll die for this.
4691,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn No, wait, it wasn't her!"
4692,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4693,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man Inside the king's tent - go
4694,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man Now.
4695,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne I won't leave him.
4696,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4697,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man Over there, go!"
4698,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne Not that way.
4699,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery We need to go home. Loras.
4700,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr My lord, my lady."
4701,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras Get out.
4702,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4703,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras And you want that privilege for yourself.
4704,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4705,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery There's no time for this.
4706,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4707,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4708,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4709,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,petyr Stannis.
4710,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4711,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery You can't stay here.
4712,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras He would have been a true king, a good king."
4713,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
4714,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras Revenge.
4715,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4716,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4717,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery He was very handsome.
4718,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr He was, Your Grace."
4719,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,"margaery Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4720,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,petyr Do you want to be a queen?
4721,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery No. I want to be the queen.
4722,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei Killed? By whom?
4723,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4724,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei Really? Who'd have thought?
4725,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4726,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei Whomever did it, I say well done."
4727,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4728,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4729,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
4730,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
4731,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion She'll be safer in Dorne.
4732,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
4733,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
4734,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
4735,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
4736,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
4737,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
4738,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
4739,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion It's important that we talk about this.
4740,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
4741,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel It's wildfire.
4742,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
4743,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel No.
4744,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion MThat's a lie right there.
4745,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
4746,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
4747,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel I'm telling you the truth.
4748,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion The smart money would be on more likely.
4749,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel She's making wildfire.
4750,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
4751,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
4752,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion I suppose there's only one way to find out.

4766,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
4767,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
4768,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
4769,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
4770,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos Your Grace, I-"
4771,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
4772,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
4773,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis You've come to lecture me on truth?
4774,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos I've come to tell you that what I saw.
4775,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
4776,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
4777,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis I'll hear no more about it.

4779,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos When do we sail for King's Landing?
4780,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
4781,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
4782,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis That's not your concern.
4783,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
4784,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
4785,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos Loyal service means telling hard truths.
4786,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
4787,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
4788,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis What do you believe?
4789,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
4790,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
4791,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
4792,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."

4797,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
4798,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
4799,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
4800,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."

4804,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion It's hard to argue with his assessment.
4805,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn Not after what he did to your birthday present.
4806,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
4807,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
4808,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion You have to admire his imagination.
4809,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn He's talking about you.
4810,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion What? Demon monkey?
4811,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
4812,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
4813,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn You don't need to convince me.

4819,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."

4822,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black,"black I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
4823,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."

4828,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
4829,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara,"yara That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."

4834,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
4835,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
4836,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer You're not.
4837,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
4838,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?

4841,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
4842,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon Take me to my ship.

4845,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,amory Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
4846,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
4847,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"reginald We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
4848,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."

4863,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.

4872,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

5046,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.

5055,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5056,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro Why?
5057,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.

5060,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro Ah, a conqueror."
5061,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5062,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."

5066,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5067,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys And behind the door?
5068,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys And it can all be mine?
5069,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5070,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys All I have to do?
5071,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro Is marry me.

5073,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5074,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."

5082,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,"jorah Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5083,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."

You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5091,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"

5190,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon He's not a pet.
5191,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5192,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon Ghost is different.
5193,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5194,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5195,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,qhorin I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5196,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon We could do the same.
5197,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5198,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon My father always said I'm of the North.

5200,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5201,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5202,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon I'll gladly give my life.
5203,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5204,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon I do.
5205,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."

I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5215,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,"tywin Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."

5224,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5225,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,"tywin Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5226,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5227,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,tywin Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5228,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5229,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,"tywin You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5230,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,"petyr After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5231,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,"tywin Yes, yes, yes."
5232,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5233,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,tywin Wants to be queen.
5234,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,"petyr Yes, she does."
5235,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,tywin House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5236,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,"petyr They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5237,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,tywin More wine for Lord Baelish.

5252,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon We could question her.
5253,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,qhorin You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
5254,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon What's your name?
5255,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,ygritte Ygritte.

5271,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"ygritte They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."

5800,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Cinda Lannister.
5801,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime Is she the fat one?
5802,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
5803,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
5804,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton I squired for you once, you know."
5805,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime When?
5806,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
5807,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
5808,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
5809,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
5810,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Bryan.
5811,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
5812,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
5813,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime You didn't, though."
5814,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton You really remember?
5815,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
5816,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton When I think back to that day-
5817,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,guard Shh!
5818,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime You were saying?
5819,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
5820,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
5821,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
5822,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime I understand completely.
5823,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
5824,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
5825,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Which knight was it?
5826,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
5827,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton What was he like?
5828,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
5829,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton It's hard to put into words.
5830,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
5831,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
5832,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Did you squire for him again?
5833,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
5834,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
5835,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton And have you thought about
5836,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime Of course. Every day.
5837,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton And?
5838,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
5839,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
5840,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton What is it?
5841,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime It's actually quite simple.
5842,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton Well, let me help you."
5843,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime You'll only have to do one thing.
5844,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton Tell me.
5845,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime You'll have to die.
5846,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,quaith Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
5847,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah,jorah I didn't come here for lessons.
5848,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,"quaith No, you came for the dragons."
5849,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah,jorah You have them? Where are they?

5869,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,xaro There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
5870,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"xaro You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.

5871,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice,"spice Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."

5918,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,"tyrion Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
5919,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
5920,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,tyrion He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
5921,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
5922,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,tyrion I thought the girls might help him.

5924,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,tyrion I was wrong. If we can't control him
5925,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
5926,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,tyrion It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
5927,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
5928,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,tyrion The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

5931,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
5932,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion,"tyrion You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."

5952,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn,catelyn You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
5953,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
5954,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn,"catelyn She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."

Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."

5969,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara What envy?
5970,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
5971,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,"yara You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"

5975,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,"yara You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
5976,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon Exactly.
5977,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
5978,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon They made me a promise
5979,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

5981,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?

5988,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
5989,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,"yara Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
5990,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
5991,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara Leave us.
5992,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,"yara Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."

And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
5995,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"ygritte I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
5996,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord,lord I already got one crow. Don't need two.

5998,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord,lord The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.

6004,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,ygritte I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6005,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord,"lord He runs, I'll chop his balls off."

6023,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa Ah.
6024,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,"robb It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."

6026,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,"robb He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6027,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6028,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,"robb He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6029,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa I wish I could have met him.
6030,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb He would have liked you.
6031,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6032,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb He didn't care much about gold or glory.
6033,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6034,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa Then why don't you?
6035,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6036,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6037,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb That would be a start.

6048,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn,"catelyn I grieve for your sons, my lord."
6049,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rickard,rickard I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6050,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn,"catelyn Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6051,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6052,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn,catelyn Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."

6117,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion You should start wearing the gold cloak.
6118,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6119,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6120,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6121,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6122,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6123,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion Fine, fine. No gold cloak."

6127,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6128,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6129,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Stannis will be here any day.
6130,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn And one of these explains how to beat him?
6131,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6132,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6133,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6134,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6135,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6136,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion For questioning?
6137,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6138,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion We talked about this.
6139,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6140,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6141,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6142,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6143,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6144,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6145,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn We could throw books at his men.
6146,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys We don't have that many books.
6147,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn We don't have that many men, either."
6148,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys What do we have?
6149,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Pig shit.
6150,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6151,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6152,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6153,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous You lack imagination.
6154,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam Where do you think Jon is right now?
6155,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6156,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,"sam He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6157,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,"grenn Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6158,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

6160,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6161,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6162,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn What in seven hells is that?
6163,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.

6166,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6167,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn It's been here a long time.
6168,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam Oh. Must be dragonglass.

6170,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam The maesters call it obsidian.
6171,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn Why would a brother hide it here?
6172,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6173,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,soldier Mind where you're going.
6174,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya I'm sorry. I'll-
6175,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya Where were you?
6176,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen A man has patrol duty.
6177,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6178,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6179,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6180,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6181,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6182,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen This a man cannot do.
6183,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya You promised you'd help me.
6184,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6185,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6186,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6187,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6188,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen A girl gives a man his own name?
6189,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya That's right.
6190,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6191,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.

6197,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya If you help me and my friends escape.
6198,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6199,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6200,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6201,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya A girl will obey.
6202,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6203,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion Thank you, Podrick."
6204,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Odd little boy.
6205,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6206,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei You and Varys both.
6207,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6208,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei He's only a boy.
6209,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6210,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei He's not ready.
6211,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6212,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6213,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6214,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Do you think I'm an idiot?
6215,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6216,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6217,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6218,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6219,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6220,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Because he doesn't have a cock.
6221,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Neither do you.
6222,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6223,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion It's not that little.
6224,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Why are you smiling?
6225,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Because I'm happy.
6226,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion And why are you happy?
6227,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Because I have your little whore.
6228,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I thought you preferred blondes.
6229,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6230,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Why do you care who I fuck?
6231,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6232,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6233,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6234,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Where did you find her?
6235,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6236,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6237,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6238,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6239,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6240,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6241,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6242,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6243,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I promise I will free you.
6244,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ros,ros Don't forget me.
6245,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Never.
6246,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6247,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei Get out.
6248,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Shae!
6249,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6250,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion You're beautiful.
6251,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae Then why do you look sad?
6252,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion We have to be more careful.
6253,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6254,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion There are people who want to hurt me.
6255,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6256,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6257,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae I'm yours.
6258,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Promise me.
6259,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae I'm yours and you are mine.
6260,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Still no word?
6261,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6262,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6263,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6264,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6265,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,"roose A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6266,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6267,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6268,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6269,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose My lady.
6270,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa How are you?
6271,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6272,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6273,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6274,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa You have every right. You're a king.
6275,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6276,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa What kind do you want to be?
6277,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6278,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6279,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6280,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa No. No, you would not."
6281,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6282,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6283,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6284,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
6285,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,hot The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
6286,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry Shut up.
6287,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,"hot Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."

6290,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,hot The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6291,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry What did he want us to do about those guards?
6292,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6293,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry What about the guards?
6294,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya He didn't say anything about the guards.
6295,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,"gendry What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6296,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya We have to trust him.
6297,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6298,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,hot I want to go back to the kitchens.
6299,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

6302,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
6303,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis Will it hold?

6306,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis I admire you, Ser Davos."
6307,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos I thank you, Your Grace."
6308,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6309,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6310,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis Do you? Why?
6311,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos My father was a crabber.
6312,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis And?
6313,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6314,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6315,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6316,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6317,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos Some are happy to do it to my face.
6318,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6319,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6320,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6321,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos He was only a boy.
6322,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6323,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6324,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6325,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6326,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos I was relieved they did not.
6327,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6328,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6329,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6330,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6331,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6332,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6333,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6334,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,"joffrey If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6335,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6336,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6337,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Imagine Stannis' terror.
6338,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys I am trying.
6339,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6340,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6341,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6342,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys I wish we could, too."
6343,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion What do you want? Tell me.
6344,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6345,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6346,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys A most highborn plumber.
6347,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6348,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6349,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I do. Last thing I expected.
6350,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys And you play it well.
6351,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6352,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6353,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6354,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6355,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion We should sail there immediately.
6356,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6357,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6358,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6359,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion One game at a time, my friend."
6360,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6361,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Astapor?
6362,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,jorah We cannot stay here.
6363,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6364,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6365,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6366,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6367,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,"daenerys Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6368,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6369,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6370,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6371,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6372,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon We should bury them.
6373,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,dagmer I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6374,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,"theon If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6375,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,dagmer What's this?
6376,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6377,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,dagmer His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6378,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,"dagmer His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6379,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6380,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin You're right so far.
6381,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6382,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin Must have been the farmer's boys.
6383,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6384,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6385,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6386,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos That's it. The tide's against us.
6387,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6388,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos You're coming home.
6389,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6390,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6391,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6392,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6393,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos Gods be good.
6394,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6395,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos But not over them?
6396,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6397,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos Well, first, we have to put it there."
6398,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6399,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6400,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6401,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae Are you afraid, my lion?"
6402,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6403,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae I won't let them hurt you.
6404,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6405,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae It is now.
6406,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6407,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6408,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6409,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei Your words are always wise and measured.
6410,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6411,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei You brought me something?
6412,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6413,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei I know what ten drops will bring.
6414,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6415,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6416,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,pycelle Yes. A siege is very-
6417,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6418,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,pycelle Your Grace.
6419,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"men And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
6420,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn To the boys!
6421,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,soldier Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
6422,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Drunk Lannisters.
6423,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute You've got a pretty voice.
6424,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Thank you very much.
6425,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6426,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6427,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute Oh.
6428,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6429,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6430,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6431,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute Poor nose.
6432,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6433,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
6434,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn I don't think he likes me.
6435,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor You think you're a hard man?
6436,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn I know it.
6437,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6438,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,"sandor Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6439,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor Only smaller.
6440,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn And quicker. Eh?
6441,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6442,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Aye I expect he will someday.
6443,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,man Here we are.
6444,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6445,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6446,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion A wedding.
6447,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6448,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6449,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6450,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6451,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys Do you trust him?
6452,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Oddly enough, I do."
6453,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys Good.
6454,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys The map you asked for.
6455,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6456,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6457,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6458,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6459,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Well, I'm not."
6460,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6461,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion What of it?
6462,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6463,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6464,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6465,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6466,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6467,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion No, I don't believe you have."
6468,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6469,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos They're welcoming the new king.
6470,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6471,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos Drums!
6472,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Remember, wait till the ships-"
6473,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn The ships are in the bay.
6474,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion They must be far enough in-
6475,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6476,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6477,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6478,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Don't get killed.
6479,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Nor you, my friend."
6480,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Oh, are we friends now?"
6481,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6482,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn Enhances it, really."
6483,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6484,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn Been spending time with fancy folks.
6485,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6486,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae Shae.
6487,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6488,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6489,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey Sansa.
6490,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6491,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey Sansa, come here."
6492,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6493,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion Will you?
6494,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa Just as I pray for the king's.
6495,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Stay safe, my lady."
6496,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae And you, my lion."
6497,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6498,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6499,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6500,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa Will you slay him yourself?
6501,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6502,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6503,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6504,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6505,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6506,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae Some of those boys will never come back.
6507,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6508,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae Shh. Come, my lady."

6510,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion On the way.
6511,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6512,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6513,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor The king has asked you a question.
6514,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6515,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,lancel The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6516,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6517,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6518,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos Where are their ships?
6519,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6520,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6521,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6522,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos Maybe.
6523,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6524,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6525,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa I doubt it.
6526,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae Maybe she's jealous of you.
6527,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa Why would she be jealous?
6528,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei Sansa.
6529,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6530,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa Yes.
6531,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6532,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6533,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei So? I didn't offer you water.
6534,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa What's he doing here?
6535,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6536,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa But we have guards to defend us.
6537,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6538,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,gold,gold The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6539,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6540,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6541,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa You said he was here to protect us.
6542,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6543,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey There they are.
6544,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion Archers to their marks.

6793,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,varys Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.

6795,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"varys Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."

6798,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,"jaime Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
6799,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,brienne One or two tried.
6800,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,"jaime Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
6801,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,brienne Not interested.
6802,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
6803,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,"jaime Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
6804,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,brienne I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

6810,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man I didn't leave it here.
6811,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man I had me dagger.

6823,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
6824,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"brienne No, stealing is a crime."
6825,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.

6831,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime For stealing a pig?
6832,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,brienne I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
6833,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man Sending him with you? How important could he be?
6834,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"man All right, have it your way, my lady."

6839,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
6840,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime Is it near Ashemark?
6841,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime I've never been there.
6842,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man What do you think of these beauties?

6848,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
6849,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,man I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
6850,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"brienne He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."

6855,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn,catelyn Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
6856,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb,robb I know that.
6857,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn,catelyn And you mean to do it anyway?

6860,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb,robb It is important to me.
6861,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn,"catelyn Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
6862,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb,"robb And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"

7168,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7169,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7170,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7171,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7172,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7173,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7174,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei You're meeting Father today?
7175,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion How do you know that?
7176,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7177,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7178,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei You're going to make me cry.
7179,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Why do you care what I want from him?
7180,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei Because you've slandered me to Father before.
7181,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Slandered? When?
7182,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7183,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7184,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei I was nine, too."
7185,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7186,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7187,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion It's not slander if it's true.
7188,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7189,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7190,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7191,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Any lies in particular?
7192,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7193,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Still makes me more clever than you.
7194,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"bronn Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
7195,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn,meryn Ser Meryn Trant.
7196,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
7197,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn,meryn You're no knight.
7198,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn Pod.
7199,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,podrick Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
7200,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn,"meryn You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
7201,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"bronn That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
7202,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn,"meryn You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
7203,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"bronn As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
7204,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
7205,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn I've been doing that for a while now.
7206,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Do you grow bored protecting me?
7207,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn I grow poor protecting you.
7208,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
7209,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn Briefly.
7210,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion I'm sure you filled your pockets.
7211,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"bronn And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
7212,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion I thought we were friends.
7213,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
7214,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion How much?
7215,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn Double.
7216,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Double?
7217,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
7218,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
7219,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn Which means you can afford it.
7220,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos Here. Here! Help me!
7221,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,man Who are you?
7222,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
7223,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,"man Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
7224,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
7225,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
7226,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor He may have swam ashore as you did.
7227,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7228,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
7229,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
7230,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7231,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos Will you take me there?
7232,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
7233,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos This war is not over.
7234,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
7235,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos We're both sworn to King Stannis.
7236,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7237,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7238,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7239,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos What?
7240,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7241,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor I'm a pirate.
7242,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos You're a smuggler.
7243,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7244,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos Take me back there, please."
7245,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor You cannot turn Stannis against her.
7246,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7247,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7248,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7249,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
7250,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
7251,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7252,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7253,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7254,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7255,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7256,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard,rickard Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7257,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,"roose The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7258,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard,rickard Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7259,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7260,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb A Mallister?
7261,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,catelyn,catelyn Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7262,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7263,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,talisa She's your mother.
7264,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
7265,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,qyburn Water. Water.
7266,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,talisa This needs to be cleaned and closed.
7267,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,"robb What's your name, friend?"
7268,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,qyburn Qyburn.
7269,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,talisa You're lucky to be alive.
7270,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,qyburn Lucky?
7271,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7272,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin Am I enjoying it?
7273,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion I was very happy as Hand of the King.
7274,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin Yes. I heard how happy you were.
7275,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin blows on his paper to dry the ink.
7276,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin You brought a whore into my bed.
7277,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion It wasn't your bed at the time.
7278,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7279,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
7280,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin What do you want, Tyrion?"
7281,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7282,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7283,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7284,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7285,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7286,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin You want Casterly Rock?
7287,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion It is mine by right.
7288,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7289,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion Why?
7290,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7291,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7292,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
7293,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae Why Dorne?
7294,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7295,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7296,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Don't ruin the game.
7297,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"shae I told you, I don't want to play."
7298,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa What about that one there?
7299,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae That one? It's going to Volantis.
7300,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Why?
7301,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"shae Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7302,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7303,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7304,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7305,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7306,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Lord Baelish.
7307,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7308,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7309,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7310,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7311,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa I won't tell anyone.
7312,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr How do I know?

Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."

7383,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."

7476,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,catelyn I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7477,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb,robb We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7478,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,catelyn Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7479,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,catelyn Something else?

They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."

7488,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime So how shall we pass the time?
7489,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne By putting one foot in front of the other.
7490,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime It's going to be a very dull walk.
7491,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7492,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7493,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7494,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime All the good it's done her.
7495,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7496,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7497,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7498,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne How would you know?
7499,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7500,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne Move.
7501,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Were you pledged to Stannis?
7502,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne Gods, no."
7503,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7504,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne Shut your mouth.
7505,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7506,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7507,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7508,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne I did not fancy him.
7509,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime Oh, gods, you did."
7510,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7511,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7512,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7513,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7514,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne Shut your mouth!
7515,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7516,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man Where are you headed, then?"
7517,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne South. You?
7518,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
7519,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime No, you really can't."
7520,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
7521,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne And you.
7522,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime He knows who I am.
7523,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne He doesn't.
7524,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7525,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7526,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7527,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Make it tighter here.
7528,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7529,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7530,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tailor,"tailor Yes, Your Grace."
7531,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Bloody flowers. On the king.
7532,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7533,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei Tell me what you think of her.
7534,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Who?
7535,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei Margaery.
7536,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7537,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,"cersei It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7538,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey Yes, she is."
7539,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7540,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Not to me.
7541,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7542,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7543,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7544,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7545,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei You need to ask yourself
7546,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey I don't need to do anything.
7547,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Better. Much better.
7548,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae I still don't believe it.
7549,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7550,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7551,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7552,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae Love is not the thing he wants.
7553,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa He's too old.
7554,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7555,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa No.
7556,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7557,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7558,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"guard Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
7559,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Send him in.
7560,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras Lady Sansa.
7561,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Ser Loras.
7562,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"loras My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7563,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"loras I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7564,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7565,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras Of course I did.
7566,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery It's more your color. You take it.
7567,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",maid,maid Thank you.
7568,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery You're such a dear.
7569,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7570,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa Thank you, Ser Loras."
7571,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7572,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Kiss me, child."
7573,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7574,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7575,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7576,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7577,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7578,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7579,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7580,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Lemon cake's my favorite.
7581,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7582,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7583,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa I haven't had the pleasure.
7584,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7585,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa I-, I-"
7586,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7587,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Has he ripped out your tongue?
7588,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7589,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7590,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7591,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Bring me some cheese.
7592,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",servant,"servant The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
7593,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7594,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7595,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa My father always told the truth.
7596,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7597,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7598,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Go on.
7599,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
7600,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
7601,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
7602,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa He's a monster.
7603,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna Ah. That's a pity.
7604,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa Please, don't stop the wedding."
7605,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
7606,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard We're at war. This march is a distraction.
7607,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb,robb My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
7608,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7609,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard Then it's a distraction.
7610,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb,robb My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
7611,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,"rickard Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."

I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."

7769,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"guard Lady Tyrell, my king."
7770,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Send her in.
7771,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
7772,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
7773,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
7774,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
7775,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
7776,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
7777,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
7778,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
7779,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
7780,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey You failed to do this.
7781,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
7782,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
7783,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
7784,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey What makes you say this?
7785,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
7786,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey No, he was a known degenerate."
7787,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
7788,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
7789,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
7790,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery You are the king.
7791,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Yes. I am.
7792,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
7793,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
7794,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
7795,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey The bolt goes here.
7796,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey And then you just aim and-
7797,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
7798,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey It's not unheard of.
7799,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery My father would never let me before-
7800,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
7801,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery May I? Please.
7802,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
7803,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
7804,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
7805,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey Yes.
7806,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery Would you like to watch me?

7812,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon What truth?
7813,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer Why'd you take Winterfell?
7814,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon I took it to-I took it-
7815,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer Who gave the orders?
7816,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon No one. I took it on my own.
7817,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer Why?
7818,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon To take the North while it was vulnerable.
7819,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer What were you going to do once you took it?
7820,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon Hold it. Rule it.
7821,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer Good. That's very good.
7822,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon Why did you do that?
7823,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
7824,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
7825,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,"theon Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
7826,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon What are you doing?
7827,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon Please.

7836,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran Only when I'm asleep.
7837,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.

7839,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen A three-eyed raven?

7841,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
7842,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran Does it have anything to do with warging?
7843,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
7844,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
7845,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
7846,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha What's he telling him?
7847,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera Why don't you ask?

7850,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
7851,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

7857,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen Yeah.

7861,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen Only one thing that matters-you.
7862,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."

7868,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
7869,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
7870,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
7871,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
7872,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
7873,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry That's because he's twice as good.
7874,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros Aha! A smith and a salesman.
7875,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya Gendry stole us weapons.

7901,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?

7903,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne Be quick about it.
7904,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime I need to rest.

7910,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
7911,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
7912,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
7913,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."

7919,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."

I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
7928,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
7929,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure I seized an opportunity.
7930,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb What value was the mill?
7931,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
7932,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb Is he there now? Of course not.
7933,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
7934,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,"robb I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
7935,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
7936,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
7937,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"brynden Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
7938,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
7939,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure No.
7940,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
7941,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb How many men did you lose?
7942,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"edmure But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
7943,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
7944,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure I'm sorry. I didn't know.
7945,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
7946,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,brynden We seem to be running short of patience here.
7947,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
7948,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.

7950,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,"tywin Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks.

In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
7954,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,"tywin Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."

7959,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
7960,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,tywin Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

7962,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,tywin It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.

7969,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.

8083,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis You refuse to tell me where you're going?
8084,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
8085,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis How long will you be gone?
8086,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre I don't know.
8087,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis You're abandoning me.
8088,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.

8090,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"melisandre When I return, you will understand."
8091,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
8092,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre I cannot.
8093,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis Why?
8094,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
8095,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
8096,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis I want you.
8097,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"melisandre Your fires burn low, my king."
8098,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre There is another way. A better way.
8099,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
8100,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,melisandre Yes.
8101,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis,stannis I'm the one true king.
8102,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"melisandre You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
8103,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"barristan The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
8104,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys To whom?
8105,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,barristan To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
8106,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Give me your water.
8107,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."

8111,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,barristan We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
8112,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
8113,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,"daenerys The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
8114,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
8115,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,barristan Three.
8116,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,jorah Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
8117,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
8118,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,"daenerys Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
8119,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"barristan When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
8120,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
8121,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,"daenerys Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
8122,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"barristan I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
8123,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
8124,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
8125,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys They did not. I want to buy them all.
8126,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei She wants to buy them all.
8127,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"kraznys She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
8128,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
8129,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
8130,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,greizhen,"greizhen If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor."
8131,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
8132,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
8133,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys The slut cannot pay for all of this.
8134,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
8135,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"kraznys Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
8136,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
8137,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
8138,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei The gold you have left is worth ten.
8139,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
8140,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
8141,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
8142,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei The Dothraki you have with you-
8143,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys I will give her three for those.
8144,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
8145,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"kraznys So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
8146,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
8147,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys I have dragons. I'll give you one.
8148,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"barristan You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
8149,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah Khaleesi, please."
8150,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys Three dragons.
8151,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys One.
8152,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys Two.
8153,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,missandei They want the biggest one.
8154,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Done.
8155,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,kraznys Done.
8156,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,"daenerys I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
8157,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
8158,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah,"jorah Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
8159,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,barristan Aegon Targaryen proved that.
8160,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,"daenerys You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
8161,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Do you have a name?
8162,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
8163,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
8164,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei No, Your Grace. No family living."
8165,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
8166,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
8167,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
8168,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
8169,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
8170,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"missandei All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
8171,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys,daenerys And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.

8175,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
8176,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Not for bastards.

8181,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
8182,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
8183,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr You should have him knighted.
8184,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion If only the Master of Coin had such power.
8185,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
8186,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
8187,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,"petyr Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
8188,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion We don't. I did fuck her once.
8189,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr I know.
8190,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion But we don't.
8191,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
8192,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
8193,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,petyr Keep a low profile.
8194,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
8195,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,"petyr Well, you are richer than I am."
8196,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Good point.
8197,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr,"petyr They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
8198,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."

8201,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion You think all reading is dull reading.
8202,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
8203,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
8204,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.

8214,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."

8221,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
8222,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn Let me guess. He's not a magician.
8223,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion No.

8230,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
8231,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."

8235,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
8236,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
8237,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn The lado s practically skipping.
8238,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
8239,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
8240,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn He's a squire. You don't pay him.
8241,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
8242,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"podrick They wouldn't take it, my lord."
8243,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
8244,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
8245,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn What did you tell them?
8246,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,podrick I didn't tell them anything.

8248,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,podrick Lots of things.
8249,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion And they seemed to like these things?
8250,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,bronn Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
8251,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Only they weren't paid.
8252,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"bronn What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
8253,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion,tyrion Is that what you're telling us?

8268,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
8269,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"brienne My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
8270,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
8271,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,man You're only making it worse.
8272,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
8273,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,man Come on!
8274,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime You know who she is, don't you?"
8275,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
8276,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
8277,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,man I'm gonna cut your throat!
8278,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
8279,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke I know what they are.
8280,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
8281,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Bring her back here.
8282,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"man Yes, my lord. Get up."
8283,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,man Come on.

8285,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Unbesmirched.
8286,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime Not defiled.
8287,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Fancy word for a fancy man.
8288,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
8289,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke I bet you did.
8290,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
8291,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
8292,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke Aye, you have both."
8293,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
8294,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Hard to argue with that.
8295,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
8296,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
8297,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"man Come on, men."
8298,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
8299,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime I'm famished, actually."
8300,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
8301,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime Well, I do like partridge."
8302,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?"
8303,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
8304,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke On the stump.
8305,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
8306,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime My father-
8307,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
8308,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime Don't.
8309,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,locke Have you got something to say?
8310,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."
8311,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"locke Here, this should help you remember."
8312,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,end,end CREDITS
8313,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,man How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
8314,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"locke Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
8315,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,brienne He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
8316,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime,"jaime Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
8317,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime,"jaime If I die, you won't be getting-"
8318,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"locke Oh, enough. Here."
8319,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,locke Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
8320,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,brienne Stop!
8321,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,man Far enough.
8322,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,locke Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
8323,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,"man Come on, you."
8324,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
8325,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion I hope we might speak. In confidence.
8326,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys Oh, always in confidence."
8327,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
8328,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
8329,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8330,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys End your life?
8331,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,"tyrion I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8332,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys Proof? Will there be a trial?
8333,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion I need to know.
8334,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8335,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion I don't know. Do I?
8336,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8337,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8338,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys You do not possess at the moment.
8339,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8340,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion The sorcerer.
8341,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8342,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8343,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous,dolorous Or the shit.
8344,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8345,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous,dolorous And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8346,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8347,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous,"dolorous Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8348,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,rast We need to get out of here.
8349,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8350,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,rast The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8351,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous,dolorous He had no way of knowing.
8352,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,rast We do now. We know what's out there.
8353,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,grenn Craster's been out here surviving.

8355,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous,dolorous We're like the sons he never had.
8356,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,"rast Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."

8390,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros They said it was hard to describe.
8391,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8392,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8393,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8394,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"ros He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."

8396,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros His shipboard inventory.
8397,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8398,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros Former profession.
8399,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8400,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8401,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8402,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"ros He's not interested in them, my lord."
8403,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys How do you know?
8404,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros Because I'm one of his girls.

8408,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor You look like a bunch of swineherds.
8409,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,anguy Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
8410,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
8411,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
8412,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
8413,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric And I won't see them again.
8414,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
8415,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
8416,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
8417,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
8418,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
8419,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor You're fighting for ghosts.
8420,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
8421,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor You found god? Is that it?
8422,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
8423,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
8424,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,"thoros You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
8425,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,"anguy And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
8426,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
8427,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,thoros House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
8428,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
8429,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,anguy Murder is a crime.
8430,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
8431,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya,arya You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
8432,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor Aye, he was a bleeder."
8433,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric You don't deny killing this boy?
8434,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
8435,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya,arya That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
8436,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
8437,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
8438,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
8439,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
8440,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"missandei The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."

8544,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
8545,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,"roose Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
8546,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,"brienne Thank you, my lord."
8547,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
8548,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Lord Bolton.
8549,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Is there word from the capital?
8550,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
8551,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
8552,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Will I die?
8553,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
8554,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
8555,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
8556,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I don't need my right hand to kill you.
8557,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
8558,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Mmm.
8559,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
8560,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime No milk of the poppy.
8561,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn There will be pain.
8562,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I'll scream.
8563,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn Quite a bit of pain.
8564,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I'll scream loudly.
8565,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei Lord Baelish.
8566,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr Your Grace.
8567,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
8568,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr Of course, Your Grace."
8569,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
8570,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
8571,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
8572,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
8573,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
8574,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr I shall do my best.
8575,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
8576,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr I assure you that it will.
8577,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
8578,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,podrick,"podrick Pardon, my lady."
8579,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
8580,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
8581,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
8582,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
8583,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna Naturally.
8584,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
8585,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
8586,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion I understand that.
8587,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna Good.
8588,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
8589,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna And?
8590,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
8591,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
8592,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
8593,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
8594,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
8595,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
8596,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion I would.
8597,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
8598,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
8599,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion My lady-
8600,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
8601,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Quite sufficient. Thank you.
8602,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
8603,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Give me that.
8604,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya What are you doing?
8605,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
8606,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya Why?
8607,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
8608,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,"arya Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
8609,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
8610,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya You don't have to do this.
8611,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry I want to. They need good men.
8612,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,"arya Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
8613,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,"gendry What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
8614,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
8615,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,"gendry He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
8616,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya I can be your family.
8617,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
8618,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,martyn Willem. Willem!
8619,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,willem,willem Is this a rescue?
8620,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard Lannister filth! Take him!
8621,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,"martyn Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
8622,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Bring them in.
8623,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
8624,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
8625,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
8626,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
8627,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb They were boys! Look at them.
8628,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
8629,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
8630,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
8631,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Leave him.
8632,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
8633,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
8634,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"man Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
8635,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
8636,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"man Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
8637,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,edmure Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
8638,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
8639,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,edmure It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
8640,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
8641,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn,catelyn The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
8642,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"talisa Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
8643,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
8644,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
8645,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn,catelyn Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
8646,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,"edmure A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
8647,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
8648,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
8649,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
8650,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb Kneel, my lord."
8651,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
8652,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
8653,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
8654,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
8655,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
8656,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros Don't think of it that way.
8657,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya But it is that way.
8658,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros It is. And it isn't.
8659,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya More is than isn't.
8660,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
8661,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya So why don't you?
8662,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros We need the gold.
8663,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"beric Do I frighten you, child?"
8664,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya No.
8665,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
8666,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya I thought he killed you.
8667,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric He did.
8668,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya But how?
8669,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
8670,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
8671,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric How many times?
8672,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros Five, I think. No, this makes six."
8673,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric Six.
8674,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
8675,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric Then I was stabbed in the belly.
8676,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
8677,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
8678,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
8679,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros And the Hound makes six.
8680,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
8681,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
8682,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"beric I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
8683,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
8684,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros I don't think it works that way, child."
8685,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"beric He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
8686,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya I would. You're alive.
8687,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"selyse Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
8688,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
8689,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis My lady.
8690,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis I meant to come sooner. The battle-
8691,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"selyse I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
8692,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,"stannis Yes, of course."
8693,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
8694,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis I believed that once.
8695,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
8696,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
8697,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse No.
8698,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
8699,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse You're doing godo s work.
8700,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
8701,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"selyse I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
8702,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"selyse Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."
8703,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis That's not true.
8704,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
8705,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis She's my daughter. I want to see her.
8706,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse You are a king. You don't need my permission.
8707,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh"
8708,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh"
8709,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis Shireen.
8710,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Father!
8711,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis You've grown since I last saw you.
8712,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
8713,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis No.
8714,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
8715,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis He did. He fought bravely.
8716,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
8717,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,"stannis He won't be visiting, child."
8718,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Why not? He's my friend. Look.
8719,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
8720,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
8721,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
8722,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne What are you doing here?
8723,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
8724,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Now get out.
8725,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne There's another tub.
8726,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
8727,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne Why should I care how you die?
8728,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
8729,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
8730,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne Don't you mock me.
8731,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
8732,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne You need trust to have a truce.
8733,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime I trust you.
8734,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
8735,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne Of course.
8736,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
8737,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
8738,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
8739,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
8740,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
8741,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime Jaime. My name is Jaime.
8742,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
8743,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
8744,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen Shh, you'll wake Bert."
8745,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos Bert?
8746,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
8747,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
8748,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
8749,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
8750,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
8751,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos Aye. So they did.
8752,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
8753,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
8754,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen Take it. I have more.
8755,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos My lady, I can't read the words."
8756,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen You can't?
8757,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
8758,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos No. No. No.
8759,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen It's easy. It'll be fun.
8760,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos Go. We can't.
8761,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
8762,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos I wouldn't know where to start.
8763,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
8764,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah It was a bitch of a siege.
8765,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
8766,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
8767,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
8768,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
8769,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
8770,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
8771,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah You swore an oath.
8772,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
8773,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah With all my heart.
8774,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys These are the ones?
8775,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"missandei Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
8776,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
8777,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys Remove your helmet
8778,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey,grey This one has the honor.
8779,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys What is your name?
8780,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey,grey Grey Worm.
8781,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys Grey Worm.
8782,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"missandei All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
8783,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,"daenerys From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
8784,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey,"grey Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
8785,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah King Robert wanted her dead.
8786,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
8787,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
8788,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan I didn't sit on the small council.
8789,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
8790,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
8791,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
8792,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
8793,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan Mm-hmm.
8794,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
8795,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
8796,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah Which men do you have in mind?
8797,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
8798,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
8799,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
8800,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
8801,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
8802,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
8803,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
8804,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
8805,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa Come to bed.
8806,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb You were right.
8807,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
8808,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa Don't let him.
8809,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
8810,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
8811,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
8812,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa Give them a new purpose.
8813,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb What?
8814,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"talisa Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
8815,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
8816,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa What is it?
8817,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
8818,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
8819,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa Can you do it?
8820,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
8821,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
8822,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery,margaery I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
8823,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
8824,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery,margaery And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
8825,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,loras Squire!

8839,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
8840,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
8841,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa What is?
8842,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
8843,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa Is it?
8844,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr Lady Margaery wears it that way.
8845,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa Many ladies wear it this way.
8846,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
8847,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa You still want me to come with you?
8848,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
8849,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,"sansa Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
8850,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
8851,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,"sansa I do, Lord Baelish."
8852,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr Petyr.
8853,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa,sansa Petyr.
8854,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
8855,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr We'll speak again when I return.
8856,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin You're late.
8857,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion What's she doing here?
8858,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
8859,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
8860,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
8861,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
8862,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
8863,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
8864,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
8865,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Your jokes are not appreciated.
8866,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion It wasn't my best, but-"
8867,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
8868,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
8869,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
8870,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
8871,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
8872,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion And how do we do that?
8873,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
8874,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Wonderful.
8875,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei Yes, it is."
8876,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion You can't mean it.
8877,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin I can and I do.
8878,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
8879,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
8880,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion She's a child!
8881,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
8882,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
8883,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion And if I refuse?
8884,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
8885,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion I was wed. Or don't you remember?
8886,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Only too well.
8887,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
8888,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
8889,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei What do you mean?
8890,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin You'll marry Ser Loras.
8891,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei I will not.
8892,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
8893,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei No, I won't do it."
8894,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
8895,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
8896,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
8897,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei Father, don't make me do it again, please."
8898,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
8899,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay."
8900,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly You've got too much wood in there.
8901,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
8902,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
8903,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,sam Huh. You know your fires.
8904,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly Someone built your fires for you growing up?
8905,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
8906,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly I knew you were highborn.
8907,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
8908,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly What does it do?
8909,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
8910,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly How much longer?
8911,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,sam Not so far. A few more days.
8912,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly Is the Wall as big as they say?
8913,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,sam Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
8914,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly You're playing with me.
8915,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
8916,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,gilly Do you sing?
8917,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"sam No. No, no, no. Not very well."

8921,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,osha That's not how you skin a rabbit.
8922,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,meera I know how to skin a rabbit.
8923,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,osha Not by the looks of it.
8924,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
8925,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,meera I didn't see any game before I got here.
8926,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
8927,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"meera Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
8928,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha You learn how to use your fists, though."
8929,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"meera Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
8930,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,osha I had someone else in mind.

8932,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran,bran You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
8933,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,osha Some of us are just a little better.
8934,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"meera Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
8935,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
8936,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran,bran Stop it!

8940,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran,bran You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
8941,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
8942,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran,"bran First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
8943,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,meera Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
8944,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"osha I said so, didn't I?"
8945,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran,bran Osha!

8967,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,ygritte He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.

8975,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,ygritte Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.

8995,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,"anguy Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
8996,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre Valar morghulis.
8997,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
8998,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre You are Thoros of Myr.
8999,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
9000,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros I failed.
9001,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"melisandre You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
9002,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
9003,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
9004,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,beric Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
9005,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros Lucky for the ladies.
9006,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre How many times has the Lord brought him back?
9007,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros Six.
9008,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre That's not possible.
9009,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros The Lord has smiled upon me.
9010,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre You should not have this power.
9011,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
9012,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9013,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre You've been to the other side.
9014,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
9015,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre You have someone He needs.
9016,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
9017,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry,"gendry Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
9018,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy I'll get you the steel.
9019,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,man,man Come on.
9020,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya I don't like that woman.
9021,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy That's 'cause you're a girl.
9022,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya What does that have to do with anything?
9023,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric Forgive me, lad."
9024,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya What are you doing? Let go of him.
9025,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
9026,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,beric We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
9027,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
9028,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
9029,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
9030,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry,gendry You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9031,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
9032,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
9033,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"melisandre I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
9034,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"ygritte You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
9035,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,tormund Look out!
9036,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,ygritte You all right?
9037,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,"tormund Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
9038,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Sorry. Were you sleeping?
9039,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Wa-
9040,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
9041,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9042,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Please.
9043,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Please is not a body part.
9044,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,"theon I'll tell you everything, please."
9045,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9046,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
9047,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9048,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,"theon If I win, you'll let me go?"
9049,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
9050,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9051,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon The North.
9052,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Too vague.
9053,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Deepwood Motte.
9054,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Terrible guess.
9055,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay Now, where?"
9056,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Last Hearth.
9057,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9058,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Karhold!
9059,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9060,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon No. It was just a guess.
9061,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9062,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Torrhen Karstark.
9063,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
9064,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
9065,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon You swore to tell me if I-
9066,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay You're right.
9067,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
9068,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Yes. You win.
9069,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
9070,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay I'm afraid I am.
9071,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay Everything I told you is a lie.
9072,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
9073,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,"theon Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
9074,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay I win.
9075,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
9076,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,"black The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
9077,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9078,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9079,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,"black As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9080,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure I don't think that's-
9081,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9082,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black And there's something else.
9083,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9084,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,"black Not what, whom."
9085,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure What?
9086,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure No.
9087,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9088,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure How old is she?
9089,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar Nineteen.
9090,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure Could I see her first?
9091,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9092,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9093,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9094,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9095,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9096,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"edmure Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9097,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9098,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9099,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9100,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9101,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9102,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,"robb It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9103,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"edmure He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9104,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,catelyn,catelyn You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9105,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9106,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden You recall that heroic engagement?
9107,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure I had something less permanent in mind.
9108,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,"robb I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9109,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure I'll marry her.
9110,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,"robb You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9111,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9112,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,"brienne Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9113,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,"roose When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9114,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose I should send you back to Robb Stark.
9115,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,"jaime You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9116,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9117,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9118,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9119,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,"jaime It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9120,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9121,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime He'll make time for you.
9122,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,"roose As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9123,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime Shall we drink on it?
9124,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose I don't partake.
9125,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9126,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,"jaime Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9127,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,"roose Oh, she won't be going with you."
9128,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,brienne I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9129,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose You are charged with abetting treason.
9130,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime I'm afraid I must insist.
9131,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9132,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna Impossible.
9133,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin Why?
9134,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9135,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9136,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna Old.
9137,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin Old?
9138,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9139,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9140,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9141,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9142,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9143,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin Of course.
9144,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna And you never-
9145,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin No.
9146,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna Not once? Not in any way?
9147,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin Never.
9148,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9149,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9150,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9151,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9152,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9153,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9154,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9155,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9156,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9157,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9158,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9159,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna Oh
9160,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9161,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9162,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9163,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9164,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell No!
9165,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell We've gotta cut them loose!
9166,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,tormund No!
9167,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon,jon Take my hand!
9168,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa That's a wonderful pin.
9169,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9170,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa I'm very happy about
9171,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9172,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa I feel like I'm in a dream.
9173,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9174,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9175,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9176,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9177,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei We can have them both killed.
9178,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9179,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9180,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion On a boat you built.
9181,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9182,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9183,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9184,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9185,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9186,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei What do you want me to say?
9187,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9188,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9189,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9190,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9191,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9192,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9193,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9194,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei Who's going to tell her?
9195,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa Do you think people will like it?
9196,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae I don't think they will even notice it.
9197,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9198,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae I'm sure he does.
9199,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa Will they let me invite my family?
9200,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae They haven't asked my opinion.
9201,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa But do you think they will?
9202,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae No.
9203,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,maid,"maid Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9204,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion I beg your pardon, my lady."
9205,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9206,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9207,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa Of course.
9208,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion Alone, if I may."
9209,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9210,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9211,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9212,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa It's all right, really."
9213,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9214,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9215,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9216,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9217,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9218,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9219,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9220,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,varys I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9221,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9222,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,varys But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9223,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9224,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9225,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
9226,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte How far are we?
9227,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon About a week, I think."
9228,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte You think? You don't know?
9229,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9230,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9231,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Most of the time, yes."
9232,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte How do the men holding the banners fight?
9233,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9234,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9235,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9236,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte So what good are they?
9237,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon They help the men march.
9238,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte How?
9239,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9240,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9241,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
9242,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte You know nothing, Jon Snow."
9243,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell She's right, you don't."
9244,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9245,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9246,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9247,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
9248,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,brynden That rain will cost us another day.
9249,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
9250,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
9251,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,brynden Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
9252,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,"catelyn Yes, and that is why-"
9253,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,"brynden I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
9254,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,"talisa I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
9255,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
9256,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,edmure,edmure He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
9257,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9258,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.

9274,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9275,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb I will.

9297,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,"sansa Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."

9299,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
9300,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,margaery You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
9301,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
9302,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,margaery Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
9303,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa No.

9306,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery You don't want him, though."
9307,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa He's a Lannister.
9308,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
9309,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
9310,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
9311,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
9312,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,margaery If it's the pain you're worried about-
9313,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
9314,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
9315,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
9316,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
9317,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa And that's a good thing?
9318,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
9319,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa,sansa How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
9320,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery,"margaery Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."

9329,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion Shae isn't going to like it.
9330,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,bronn Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
9331,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion I should never have told you about that.
9332,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"bronn You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
9333,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
9334,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"bronn You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
9335,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.

9339,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin You wanted to speak to me?
9340,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
9341,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9342,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9343,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin Of course.
9344,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9345,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin I have, yes."
9346,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey May I ask why?
9347,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9348,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,"joffrey So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9349,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin We could arrange to have you carried.
9350,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9351,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin Where did you hear about this?
9352,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey Is it true?
9353,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin Apparently so.
9354,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
9355,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9356,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9357,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9358,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9359,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9360,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey But I haven't been counseled.
9361,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin You are being counseled at this very moment.
9362,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey,joffrey I should be consulted about such things.
9363,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,"tywin From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
9364,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah,jorah Yunkai. The Yellow City.
9365,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,"barristan The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
9366,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah,"jorah On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
9367,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
9368,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah,"jorah We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
9369,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
9370,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah,jorah Two hundred thousand if not more.
9371,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
9372,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,"daenerys Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
9373,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"missandei Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
9374,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"missandei Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
9375,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys You may approach. Sit.
9376,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,missandei Will the noble lord take refreshment?
9377,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,"radzal Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
9378,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
9379,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,"radzal If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
9380,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
9381,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
9382,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys My ship?
9383,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,"radzal Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
9384,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys And what do you ask in return?
9385,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
9386,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
9387,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal My life?
9388,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,"daenerys And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
9389,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,"radzal You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
9390,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal You swore me safe conduct.
9391,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,"daenerys I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
9392,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal,radzal Take the gold.
9393,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,"daenerys My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
9394,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,barristan The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
9395,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys,daenerys And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
9396,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah,jorah I don't know.

9403,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion What?

9409,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,"tyrion That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
9410,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,shae Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
9411,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion I don't have a choice. My father-
9412,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,shae Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
9413,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion,tyrion What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

9433,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry,gendry I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
9434,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"melisandre Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."

9524,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon It's too far away.
9525,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte Is that a palace?
9526,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon It's a windmill.
9527,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
9528,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Just the men who used to live here.
9529,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
9530,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Winterfell has towers three times that size.
9531,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
9532,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
9533,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte What's swooning?
9534,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Fainting.
9535,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte What's fainting?
9536,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon When a girl sees blood and collapses.
9537,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
9538,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Well not all girls are like you.
9539,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
9540,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.

9543,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon So I could tear it off you.
9544,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
9545,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
9546,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
9547,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
9548,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte You know nothing-
9549,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
9550,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte And how do you know that?
9551,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
9552,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte Mance is different.
9553,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
9554,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte You don't know that.
9555,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
9556,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte All of us.
9557,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
9558,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon Yes, first we'll live."
9559,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
9560,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,hodor,hodor Hodor.
9561,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen That's where we are.

9563,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,"bran It's all right, Osha."
9564,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
9565,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,meera,meera Leave him alone.
9566,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha He can speak for himself.
9567,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen I don't fill his head with anything.
9568,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha So what do you talk about?
9569,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen What's happening to him and what that means.
9570,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
9571,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
9572,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
9573,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen We're not going to Castle Black.
9574,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha What did you say?
9575,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
9576,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
9577,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
9578,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
9579,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
9580,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
9581,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran You don't understand. You don't know.
9582,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
9583,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
9584,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn How is the pain, my lord?"
9585,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
9586,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn Well, we've stymied the corruption."
9587,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
9588,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn All the good it's done me.
9589,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
9590,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn Faint praise, my lord."
9591,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
9592,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
9593,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime What is?
9594,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
9595,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime You performed experiments on living men.
9596,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn On dying men.
9597,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime With their permission?
9598,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
9599,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
9600,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn How many men have you killed, my lord?"
9601,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime I don't know.
9602,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn Fifty? A hundred?
9603,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn Countless.
9604,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Countless has a nice ring to it.
9605,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn And how many lives have you saved?
9606,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
9607,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
9608,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime A fair offer.
9609,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
9610,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Why not?
9611,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
9612,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn He feels he's being cheated.
9613,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime They'd be fools to kill her.
9614,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
9615,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime We have to return to Harrenhal.
9616,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks Why?
9617,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime I've left something behind.
9618,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
9619,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime And what are those orders?
9620,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
9621,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime You think you'll get a reward.
9622,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
9623,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
9624,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks I had nothing-
9625,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
9626,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Whoa.
9627,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,"steelshanks Eyes open, lads."
9628,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Be quiet.
9629,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,men,"men The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
9630,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,man,man Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
9631,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,"locke Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
9632,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime A wooden sword?
9633,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke I thought you'd gone.
9634,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime You gave her a wooden sword.
9635,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke We've only got one bear.
9636,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
9637,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
9638,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
9639,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,brienne Ah!
9640,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Get behind me.
9641,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,brienne I will not.
9642,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
9643,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
9644,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime Pull her up.
9645,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,brienne Hold my legs.
9646,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,brienne Pull him up!
9647,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke The bitch stays.
9648,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
9649,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
9650,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
9651,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
9652,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,"sandor I'll give you one try, girl."
9653,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,"sandor Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
9654,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,"sandor Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
9655,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya There's no one worse than you.
9656,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,"sandor Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
9657,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya You're lying.
9658,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,"sandor Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
9659,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya Is that the Blackwater?
9660,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
9661,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
9662,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
9663,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya But why?
9664,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
9665,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya,arya Why would they be at the Twins?
9666,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
9667,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,barristan Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
9668,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,jorah They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
9669,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys You know these men?
9670,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,"jorah Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
9671,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Is he more titan or bastard?
9672,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,"jorah He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
9673,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys How many?
9674,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"barristan Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
9675,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Enough to make a difference?
9676,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
9677,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,jorah I imagine you're right.
9678,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
9679,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,jorah He may not agree to meet.
9680,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
9681,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"barristan Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"

9685,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
9686,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero You, slave girl, bring wine."
9687,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys We have no slaves here.
9688,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
9689,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
9690,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"barristan Under two thousand, Your Grace."
9691,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys We have more, don't we?"
9692,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,barristan Ten thousand Unsullied.
9693,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
9694,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
9695,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys You're very young to be a captain.
9696,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
9697,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
9698,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
9699,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah,jorah The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
9700,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Or you could fight for me.
9701,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
9702,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys I would pay you as much and more.
9703,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,"prendahl Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
9704,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
9705,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
9706,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
9707,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
9708,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,grey,"grey My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
9709,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
9710,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
9711,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys A barrel, then."

9719,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre You know what I mean to do with him.
9720,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,"stannis Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."

9722,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis No.
9723,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
9724,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis You've slaughtered many lambs?
9725,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre And none have seen the blade.

9731,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
9732,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis Yeah.
9733,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
9734,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis Melisandre's returned.
9735,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos I didn't know she'd been gone.
9736,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
9737,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos Why?
9738,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis She says there's power in king's blood.
9739,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos She's going to kill him.
9740,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis Sacrifice him.
9741,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
9742,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
9743,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos Because he has your blood in his veins.
9744,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis So did Renly.
9745,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."

The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
9747,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
9748,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
9749,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
9750,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis You have little regard for your own life.
9751,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
9752,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,"stannis I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
9753,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
9754,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario You talk too much.
9755,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
9756,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
9757,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
9758,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
9759,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
9760,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
9761,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
9762,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario I fight for beauty.
9763,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl For beauty?
9764,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero We fight for gold.
9765,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
9766,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero You'll die young.
9767,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
9768,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
9769,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl She's well guarded.
9770,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
9771,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl Which one of us?
9772,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero Close your eyes, love."
9773,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
9774,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
9775,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario You have something for me?
9776,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario Valar morghulis.
9777,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Lady Sansa.
9778,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa You look very handsome, my lord."
9779,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
9780,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
9781,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
9782,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
9783,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa I doubt that very much, my lord."
9784,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
9785,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
9786,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa When I have to.
9787,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion Well, today you have to."
9788,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,"margaery You look radiant, Your Grace."
9789,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei Radiant? Why radiant?
9790,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery It's the word that came to mind.
9791,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
9792,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
9793,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,"margaery A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
9794,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
9795,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery Of course. They play it so often here at court.
9796,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
9797,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,"margaery Not as well as you, I'm sure."
9798,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
9799,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
9800,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery Gone.
9801,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
9802,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
9803,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
9804,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa What are you doing?
9805,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,"joffrey Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
9806,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,septon You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
9807,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Could you-
9808,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Thank you.
9809,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,"septon Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
9810,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre Have you ever seen one like it?
9811,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
9812,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
9813,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
9814,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre Here, taste this."
9815,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre You think I'm trying to poison you?
9816,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry That's good.
9817,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry That's really good.
9818,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre Where do you think it's from?
9819,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry I couldn't even guess.
9820,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
9821,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
9822,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre There are no mistakes. Not for us.
9823,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
9824,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
9825,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
9826,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
9827,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
9828,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
9829,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry What are you doing?
9830,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre You have to trust me.
9831,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry What-? Get it away. Get it off me.
9832,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
9833,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry Why are you doing this?
9834,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
9835,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
9836,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
9837,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
9838,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
9839,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,olenna,"olenna So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
9840,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa Will you pardon me, my lord?"
9841,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
9842,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
9843,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey I've got a lifetime for that.
9844,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei Stay.
9845,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,tywin You seem rather drunk.
9846,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
9847,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
9848,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion And?
9849,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
9850,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
9851,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,tywin More than once.
9852,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
9853,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
9854,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,loras,"loras Well, my father once told me-"
9855,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei Nobody cares what your father once told you.
9856,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,"joffrey Congratulations, my lady."
9857,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa Thank you, Your Grace."
9858,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,"joffrey Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day."
9859,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa Yes, Your Grace."
9860,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
9861,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
9862,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey Time for the bedding ceremony.
9863,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion There will be no bedding ceremony.
9864,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,"joffrey Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
9865,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey There will be if I command it.
9866,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
9867,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,joffrey What did you say? What did you say?
9868,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
9869,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
9870,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
9871,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
9872,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
9873,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
9874,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa Is that wise, my lord?"
9875,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
9876,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa Is that wise, Tyrion?"
9877,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Nothing was ever wiser.
9878,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Astoundingly long.
9879,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa What?
9880,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
9881,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa Fourteen.
9882,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
9883,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
9884,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa But your father-
9885,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
9886,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa What if I never want you to?
9887,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion And so my watch begins.
9888,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Ninteen

9890,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
9891,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
9892,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
9893,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
9894,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
9895,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei Athjahakar.

9899,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
9900,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,"missandei Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
9901,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario No screaming or she dies.
9902,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys What do you want?
9903,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario You.
9904,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Let her go.
9905,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario Don't scream, lovely girl."
9906,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys You were sent here to kill me?
9907,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys So why haven't you?
9908,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario I don't want to.
9909,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys What do your captains have to say about that?
9910,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario You should ask them.
9911,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Why?
9912,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario We had philosophical differences.
9913,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Over what?
9914,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
9915,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys You're a strange man.
9916,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
9917,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys And this is supposed to impress me?
9918,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario Yes.
9919,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
9920,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
9921,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Will you fight for me?
9922,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys Swear to me.
9923,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
9924,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion You really ought to knock.
9925,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,shae,shae I brought your breakfast.
9926,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
9927,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam How hard can it be to build a fire?
9928,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
9929,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam He winked at me before.
9930,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly I doubt it.
9931,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam I saw him wink at me.
9932,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly He blinked.
9933,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
9934,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly A what?
9935,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
9936,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly A wink is on purpose.
9937,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
9938,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
9939,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam What? No. This is just the way I talk.
9940,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly I'll build that fire.
9941,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam Don't you think he should have a name?
9942,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly I don't know many boys' names.
9943,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
9944,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Craster.
9945,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
9946,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Mormont.
9947,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
9948,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Why is it a last name?
9949,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
9950,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
9951,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam No, Randyll Tarly."
9952,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Randyll is a handsome name.
9953,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam Please don't name him Randyll.
9954,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Is your father cruel like mine?
9955,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam Different manner of cruel.
9956,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly Not Randyll, then."
9957,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly Don't. Don't go out there.
9958,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam I'll be back. I just want to look.
9959,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
9960,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly It's come for the baby.
9961,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam Stay back!
9962,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam You stay back!
9963,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly No, you can't have him! No!"
9964,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly No!
9965,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn Are you sure about this?
9966,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb No.
9967,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn It's dangerous.
9968,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
9969,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn Why are you telling me?
9970,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
9971,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
9972,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
9973,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn We have enough men?
9974,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb If Walder Frey cooperates.
9975,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,"catelyn If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
9976,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
9977,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
9978,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
9979,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
9980,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
9981,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
9982,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
9983,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
9984,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
9985,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care."
9986,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
9987,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,merry,merry I'm Merry.
9988,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
9989,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
9990,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder Very good.
9991,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you."
9992,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder Still can't see you. Old eyes.
9993,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
9994,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
9995,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
9996,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
9997,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb Thank you, my lord."
9998,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
9999,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys,daenerys Where?
10000,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario There.
10001,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10002,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah Your men but not you?
10003,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
10004,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
10005,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,barristan We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10006,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10007,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10008,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,"jorah Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10009,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10010,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
10011,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys,"daenerys Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
10012,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,grey,grey I trust him.
10013,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys,daenerys You leave tonight.
10014,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah Very good. We'll prepare.
10015,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,barristan Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.
10016,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,"jorah You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10017,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,"sam We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10018,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly How do you know all that?
10019,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,sam I read about it in a very old book.
10020,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10021,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,sam Yes.
10022,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly You're like a wizard.
10023,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
10024,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10025,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,"pig The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10026,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor Need a hand?
10027,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig Need about eight hands.
10028,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10029,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig Many thanks.

10033,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor More than anyone you know.
10034,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
10035,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor That so?
10036,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
10037,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor That him?
10038,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya No.
10039,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor Good.
10040,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
10041,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
10042,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha Where are we?
10043,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,"bran The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."

10045,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,meera It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
10046,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran Wildlings.
10047,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,"bran Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10048,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,rickon Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10049,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,rickon That's what Old Nan said.
10050,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen There's a storm coming.

10053,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
10054,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell Only one old man and eight good horses.
10055,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund What's one old man doing with eight horses?
10056,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon He breeds them for the Watch.
10057,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte How's he keep folks from stealing them?
10058,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon The Watch protects him.
10059,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,"orell Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
10060,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund And proper steel.
10061,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell Let's carve him up.
10062,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.

10064,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10065,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10066,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"tormund I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."

10072,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,"sandor Don't worry, they're still there."
10073,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya I know they're still there.

10075,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya I'm not afraid.
10076,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,"sandor Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
10077,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
10078,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,"arya When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10079,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,"arya And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
10080,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor That give you some ideas?
10081,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya Might do.
10082,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
10083,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.

10086,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10087,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10088,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha Some climb straight up the ice.
10089,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

10091,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
10092,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10093,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.

10155,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10156,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah That's what you call a few guards?

10165,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
10166,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran They can't do that north of the Wall?
10167,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen No one can do that. Anywhere.

10182,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
10183,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.

10208,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"roose Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
10209,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn I hope she makes you very happy.
10210,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"roose Well, she's made me very rich."
10211,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,"blackfish Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
10212,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
10213,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,talisa Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
10214,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
10215,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"talisa And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand."
10216,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
10217,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb Striking your king is an act of treason.
10218,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"talisa No, don't. Don't insult them."
10219,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder Your Grace.
10220,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?"

10222,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
10223,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure,"edmure Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again ."
10224,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn Poor girl.
10225,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,roose Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
10226,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,"catelyn Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
10227,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,talisa That is a very strange custom.
10228,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
10229,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,talisa It seems normal to you?
10230,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10231,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"talisa No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10232,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb Boy or girl?
10233,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"talisa I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
10234,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
10235,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,talisa Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10236,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb I do.

10244,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey,frey Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!
10245,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
10246,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder I've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

10268,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10269,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa What are you doing?
10270,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion I have a list.
10271,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa A list of people you mean to kill?
10272,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10273,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa You should learn to ignore them.
10274,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10275,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10276,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10277,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa So how should we punish them?
10278,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Who? Whom?
10279,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10280,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10281,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa I hear that you're a pervert.
10282,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10283,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,"sansa We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10284,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Lady Sansa!
10285,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10286,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Why sheep shift?
10287,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,sansa That's the vulgar word for dung.
10288,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion My lady-
10289,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa,"sansa Well, you asked me."
10290,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,girl,girl Oh! That's him!
10291,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,podrick,"podrick My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."
10292,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Killed a few puppies today?
10293,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,"joffrey Show him. Come on, show him."
10294,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"pycelle Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
10295,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10296,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10297,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10298,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10299,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,"joffrey Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10300,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10301,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,"joffrey Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10302,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10303,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10304,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10305,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"pycelle Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10306,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey I am the king! I will punish you.
10307,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10308,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10309,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10310,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Come along.
10311,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey I'm not tired.
10312,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10313,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10314,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey,joffrey I'm not tired!
10315,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Come.
10316,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Not you.
10317,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10318,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10319,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10320,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin You really think a crown gives you power?
10321,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion No. I think armies give you power.
10322,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Mm-hmm.
10323,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10324,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10325,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10326,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10327,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10328,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10329,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10330,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion The Northerners will never forget.
10331,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10332,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10333,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10334,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10335,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion I will not rape her.
10336,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10337,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10338,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10339,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin Does that amuse you?
10340,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10341,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin Easy for me, is it?"
10342,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10343,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10344,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Sansa.
10345,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera It's empty.
10346,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen Let's find a place to sleep.
10347,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,hodor Hodor. Hodor.
10348,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran Don't, Hodor."
10349,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran Maybe we shouldn't stay.
10350,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera You'd rather be out there?
10351,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10352,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen I always quite liked the horrible stories.
10353,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran So did I. Once.
10354,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10355,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera No. Who's he?
10356,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10357,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
10358,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10359,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
10360,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose The Blackfish escaped.
10361,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10362,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose As you say.
10363,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10364,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose You'll be needing a new young girl.
10365,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
10366,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10367,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
10368,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10369,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
10370,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose Forever young.
10371,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10372,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10373,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10374,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10375,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder Oh. And?
10376,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
10377,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10378,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10379,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10380,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10381,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10382,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay But my father taught me to aim for their head.
10383,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon Kill me.
10384,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay Sorry, what?"

10389,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay Stinking meat.
10390,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?

10413,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."

10416,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran I don't want to. I have to.
10417,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen How did you get through the Wall?
10418,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10419,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10420,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
10421,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10422,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10423,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10424,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
10425,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam How do you know all that?
10426,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10427,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam But you're going to stop them?
10428,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."

10436,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10437,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
10438,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10439,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
10440,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,man Get those ropes!
10441,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.

10444,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.

10446,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam Killing White Walkers.

10449,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
10450,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10451,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran Take it, Hodor."
10452,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."

10455,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry Great. Never better.
10456,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos It was just a bit of blood.
10457,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10458,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I'm not a highborn.
10459,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry She called you Ser. I heard it.
10460,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10461,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10462,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I lived below the Street of Flour.
10463,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10464,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10465,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry Gin Alley.
10466,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
10467,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
10468,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
10469,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
10470,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10471,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry So how'd you become a lord?
10472,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos Oh, that's a long story."
10473,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10474,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10475,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry You see? Highborns.
10476,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10477,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry Why did you?
10478,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10479,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry Does he?
10480,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos He's dead.
10481,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry How'd he die?

10485,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys You were only a child.
10486,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10487,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10488,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10489,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10490,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10491,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys No, I expect not."
10492,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10493,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"

10495,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.

You'll have suitors lining up."
10498,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae Why do you want me to leave?

He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."

10508,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
10509,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
10510,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10511,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10512,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10513,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10514,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10515,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei So she can have some happiness in her life.
10516,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion You have children. How happy would you say you are?
10517,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,"cersei Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
10518,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion Even Joffrey?
10519,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,"cersei Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
10520,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion How long does it go on?
10521,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

10523,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

10526,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
10527,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
10528,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey You sewed it on?
10529,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey I did.
10530,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.

10536,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?

10538,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey What kind of coin is that?

10577,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,shireen My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
10578,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.

10613,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

10662,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys,daenerys It's all right. These people won't hurt me.

10664,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys,daenerys Let me pass

10666,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Magnificent.
10667,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin Mm-hmm.
10668,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Looks fresh-forged.
10669,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin It is.
10670,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
10671,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
10672,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
10673,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin From someone who no longer had need of it.
10674,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
10675,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin And now we have two.
10676,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Two?
10677,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
10678,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime Well, thank you. It's glorious."
10679,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin You'll have to train your left hand.
10680,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
10681,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin You'll never be as good.
10682,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
10683,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
10684,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
10685,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
10686,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
10687,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
10688,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Home?
10689,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
10690,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
10691,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
10692,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
10693,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
10694,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime No.
10695,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin No?
10696,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin I don't believe I asked you a question.
10697,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime There's my answer.
10698,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin If you think your bloody honor comes before...
10699,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
10700,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin What do you want?
10701,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Supper would be nice.
10702,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,"tywin For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
10703,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime I suppose you want the sword back.
10704,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin Keep it.
10705,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
10706,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
10707,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion Please don't.
10708,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
10709,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
10710,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
10711,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
10712,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
10713,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
10714,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn Oh.
10715,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Ah, here we are."
10716,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion Can you read the sigils?
10717,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn Yellow balls?
10718,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"podrick Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
10719,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
10720,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn I need a sigil.
10721,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
10722,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"podrick I don't see it, my lord."
10723,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
10724,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,dornish The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
10725,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
10726,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,dornish Will he?
10727,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion And where is Prince Oberyn?
10728,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,"dornish Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
10729,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
10730,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion You must be weary after such a long journey.
10731,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
10732,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
10733,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
10734,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
10735,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
10736,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Look at this one. How lovely is she?
10737,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,ellaria Beautiful. But pale.
10738,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
10739,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn You like?
10740,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,ellaria Timid. Timid bores me.
10741,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
10742,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
10743,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn You're not timid, are you?"
10744,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,ellaria Not timid.

10749,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"ellaria Oh, I'm not a lady."
10750,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,olyvar A term of courtesy in this establishment.
10751,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,ellaria A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
10752,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,olyvar Any of the others?
10753,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn The two girls can leave.
10754,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn You stay.
10755,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"olyvar I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
10756,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.

10762,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn My way .

10767,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"morgan With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."

10769,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
10770,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgans,morgans I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
10771,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn We don't like the smell.
10772,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"ellaria Come with me, lover."
10773,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"morgan Gods, look at this one."
10774,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"olyvar Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
10775,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,morgan Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
10776,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
10777,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
10778,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
10779,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
10780,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
10781,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion trouble.

10786,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn What are you? His hired killer?
10787,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
10788,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn How did that come to pass?
10789,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn Killed the right people, I suppose."

10792,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
10793,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
10794,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, they take all kinds."
10795,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Even Dornishmen.
10796,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
10797,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
10798,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
10799,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
10800,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn I was invited to the royal wedding.
10801,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion I thought we were speaking truth.
10802,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
10803,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion I wasn't actually present.
10804,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"

10806,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion I've heard rumors.
10807,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,oberyn So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
10808,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
10809,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn,"oberyn If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."

10820,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys,daenerys What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
10821,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,daario The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.

10893,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
10894,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
10895,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
10896,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,"cersei Well, they smell like Pycelle."

10900,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,"cersei Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
10901,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime It must have been traumatic for you.
10902,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
10903,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime A rather short siege.
10904,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,"cersei A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
10905,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Father disowned me today.
10906,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

10908,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,"cersei You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
10909,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
10910,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei Not now.
10911,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

10913,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
10914,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime What do you want me to apologize for?
10915,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei For leaving me.

10918,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."

10920,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime I... What are you saying?
10921,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei,cersei I'm saying you took too long.

10923,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime Go away.

10926,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,ygritte Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
10927,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund We wait for Mance's orders.
10928,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"ygritte You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
10929,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."

10931,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
10932,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,ygritte I did.
10933,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."

10940,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund Help yourself.
10941,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr Maybe everything's just better fed down here.

They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
10982,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,jon Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

11042,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"daario You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever.

11057,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?

11150,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
11151,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,myranda I only wounded her.
11152,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
11153,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,"theon A fine shot, master. My lady."
11154,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"tansy Please, my lord. It hurts."
11155,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
11156,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,myranda She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
11157,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
11158,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,tansy Why? I did whatever you asked.
11159,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay But you made Myranda feel jealous.
11160,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,myranda Me jealous of her?
11161,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"tansy My lord, please."
11162,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
11163,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
11164,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay Not so pretty now.
11165,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
11166,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,podrick Is it solid gold?
11167,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime Gilded steel.
11168,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
11169,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime I'm not hungry.
11170,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
11171,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
11172,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime Oh!
11173,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,podrick I'll clean it up.
11174,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime No, I'll do it. Leave us."
11175,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion It's only wine.
11176,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime I can't fight anymore.
11177,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion What about your left?
11178,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
11179,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
11180,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
11181,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
11182,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
11183,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
11184,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
11185,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
11186,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime Is this place safe?
11187,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
11188,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime Uh-huh.
11189,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
11190,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
11191,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
11192,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
11193,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
11194,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn Best time to attack a man.
11195,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
11196,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn Plan on growing it back?
11197,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime Come on, then."
11198,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,man Open the gates!

11204,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"roose See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
11205,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,woman,"woman This way, my lady."
11206,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose Where is your prize?
11207,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
11208,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
11209,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
11210,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay Father.
11211,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose What did you do to him?
11212,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11213,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose You flayed him.
11214,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11215,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11216,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11217,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"roose My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11218,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11219,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11220,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11221,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11222,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11223,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose I placed far too much trust in you.
11224,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11225,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,"theon I'm sorry, my lord."
11226,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay Give him the razor.
11227,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11228,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11229,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11230,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,"theon I don't know, my lord."
11231,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11232,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11233,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,"theon No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11234,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,ramsay And crisped them so no one would know.
11235,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,"theon Yes, my lord."
11236,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11237,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
11238,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose You ready for a hunt?
11239,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meryn,meryn Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11240,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11241,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon,theon Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
11242,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
11243,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11244,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay,"ramsay Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11245,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"roose You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
11246,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
11247,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
11248,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, to be foreign."
11249,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys Ahem.
11250,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
11251,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
11252,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,"varys No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11253,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
11254,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
11255,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,"tyrion She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
11256,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
11257,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,"mace From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
11258,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,mace May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
11259,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey,"joffrey A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"

11267,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"pycelle Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
11268,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey,joffrey So they say.
11269,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey,joffrey Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?

11293,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion I need you to leave.
11294,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,shae I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
11295,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion Shae.
11296,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,"shae We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
11297,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
11298,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,shae How many whores have you been with?
11299,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
11300,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
11301,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
11302,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell,"axell Sire, I served you well."
11303,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre Lord of Light, show us the way..."
11304,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell,"axell Selyse, you're my sister!"
11305,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse Yours are the stars that guide us.
11306,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell,axell Tell him! Tell him!
11307,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
11308,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
11309,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,davos Lord Florent was your brother by law.
11310,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis He was an infidel.
11311,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"davos He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
11312,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
11313,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,davos How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
11314,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis A good deal more than you.
11315,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
11316,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"davos I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
11317,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis Meat's off.
11318,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse Our larders are almost empty.
11319,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,"stannis Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
11320,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse You hate fish.
11321,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,"stannis I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
11322,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
11323,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis Of course I remember.
11324,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
11325,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre It's all I knew when I was a child.
11326,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse Until you found the Lord of Light?
11327,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre Until he found me.
11328,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse I fear for our daughter's soul.
11329,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
11330,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse She's a stubborn little beast.
11331,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis She's a child.
11332,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
11333,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
11334,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
11335,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen Come in.
11336,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre Were you sleeping, Princess?"
11337,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
11338,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen I heard it.
11339,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre And it frightened you?
11340,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
11341,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
11342,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen But they screamed.
11343,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
11344,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
11345,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
11346,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen And you didn't have this.
11347,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
11348,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,"shireen I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
11349,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
11350,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
11351,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."

11354,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,meera You've been gone for hours.
11355,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran,bran I was hungry.

11357,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran,bran I was just eating.
11358,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"jojen Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
11359,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"jojen Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
11360,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,"meera You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
11361,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran,"bran Hodor, take me to the tree."
11362,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,threeeyed,threeeyed Look for me... beneath the tree.

11371,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,olenna It feels proportionate.
11372,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin,tywin Proportionate to what?
11373,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,olenna The expected extravagance.
11374,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin,tywin People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
11375,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,olenna You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
11376,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
11377,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
11378,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin,tywin Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
11379,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long.

11380,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin,tywin I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
11381,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."

11387,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion How do you know?
11388,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."

As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
11395,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion My lady. My lady.
11396,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."

11408,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,jaime Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
11409,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,loras They certainly are.
11410,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.

11411,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,loras And neither will you.

11417,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey,joffrey You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.

11419,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey,joffrey A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
11420,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,brienne I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

11425,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
11426,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"brienne In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
11427,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
11428,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"brienne Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
11429,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
11430,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"brienne I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."

11443,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.

11460,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn,"oberyn I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
11461,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,"cersei I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."

In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."

This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."

11568,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
11569,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,"margaery Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
11570,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
11571,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery What was it like?
11572,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,olenna They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
11573,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
11574,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
11575,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery But I would have been the queen.
11576,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,olenna Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
11577,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
11578,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin I'm not trying to trick you.

11581,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen A good king?
11582,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
11583,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei This is hardly the place or the time.
11584,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen Holiness?
11585,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
11586,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen Justice.
11587,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
11588,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen No.
11589,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin No.
11590,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen What about strength?
11591,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
11592,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen Wisdom.
11593,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Yes!
11594,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen Wisdom is what makes a good king.
11595,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
11596,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
11597,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen A king needs a queen.
11598,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
11599,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen Yes.
11600,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
11601,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
11602,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime How are you?
11603,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen I'm all right.
11604,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
11605,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
11606,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,septon,"septon Yes, my lord. All of you."
11607,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
11608,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime I don't know what I saw.
11609,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
11610,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
11611,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
11612,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
11613,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei Jaime, not here, please. Please."
11614,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
11615,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime No.
11616,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei Stop it. Stop.
11617,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei Stop. Stop. It's not right.
11618,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei It's not right. It's not right.
11619,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime I don't care.
11620,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei Don't.
11621,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei Don't. Jaime, don't."
11622,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
11623,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor Near Fairmarket, I think."
11624,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya You think? You don't have a map?
11625,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor No, I don't have a map."
11626,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya Maybe we should get one.
11627,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
11628,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya How far is it to the Eyrie?
11629,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Far.
11630,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya And you're sure we're going the right way?
11631,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
11632,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya On your way where?
11633,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
11634,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya I'd like to see Braavos one day.
11635,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Why Braavos?
11636,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya I have friends there.
11637,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor I doubt it.
11638,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer Seven blessings to you.
11639,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor What do you want?
11640,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer What do I want? This is my land.
11641,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
11642,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
11643,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya He's never been the same.
11644,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer Which house did he fight for?
11645,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya The Tullys of Riverrun.
11646,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,"farmer There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
11647,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
11648,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
11649,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya Father!
11650,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
11651,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
11652,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya I'm so sorry.
11653,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya Really good.
11654,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer Did you fight at the Twins?
11655,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
11656,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
11657,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Guest right don't mean much anymore.
11658,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,"farmer It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
11659,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor You got any ale?
11660,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer Afraid not.
11661,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor How can a man not keep ale in his home?
11662,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,"farmer You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
11663,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
11664,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Fair wages for fair work.
11665,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya What did you do?!
11666,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor Get your horse saddled.
11667,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya You told me you weren't a thief.
11668,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor I wasn't.
11669,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya He took us in. He fed us and you...
11670,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
11671,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya You don't know that.
11672,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
11673,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
11674,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
11675,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ranger,ranger Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.

11679,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,janos,janos No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
11680,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam They all think I'm lying.
11681,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly About what?
11682,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam Killing the white Walker.
11683,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.

11685,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly A what?
11686,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam Well, a wildling."
11687,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly My father hated that word.
11688,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
11689,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,"gilly I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
11690,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
11691,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
11692,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
11693,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly Why do you worry about it?
11694,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam 100 men, one woman."
11695,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly They've got other things to think about.
11696,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam That's the only thing they think about.
11697,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly You're being silly.
11698,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
11699,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly What about you?
11700,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.

11703,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly For worrying about me.
11704,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
11705,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly So what are you saying?
11706,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
11707,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly Are you bored of me?
11708,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.

11713,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis,stannis The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
11714,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"davos I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
11715,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis,stannis What progress have you made?

11743,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"davos Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
11744,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,shireen My father says a criminal is a criminal.
11745,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
11746,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,shireen You've sailed to Braavos?
11747,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"davos Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
11748,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,shireen What was that for?
11749,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos I need you to write a message.
11750,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,shireen You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
11751,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
11752,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
11753,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,shireen But that's not you.
11754,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
11755,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
11756,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles Precious little thing.
11757,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles What's his name?
11758,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly Sam.
11759,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles Lovely. That the daddy?
11760,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly No.
11761,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles Where's the daddy?
11762,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly He's dead.
11763,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles Oh. Where you from?
11764,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly North of here.
11765,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles North of here? You a fucking wildling?
11766,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles Only room and board?
11767,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
11768,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,"moles Could find other work for her, too."
11769,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam No other work.
11770,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles,moles There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
11771,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
11772,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly You protected me north of the Wall.
11773,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
11774,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam You have to trust me. It's for the best.
11775,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly Best for you.
11776,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
11777,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Greedy.
11778,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,ellaria No?
11779,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,"olyvar I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
11780,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
11781,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"ellaria That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
11782,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Your loss.
11783,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
11784,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Does that surprise you?
11785,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar Everyone has a preference.
11786,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
11787,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
11788,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn What are you, 25?"
11789,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,ellaria Children.
11790,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
11791,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar Did you?
11792,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,ellaria He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
11793,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn They will all have to line up behind you.
11794,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Prince Oberyn.
11795,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Lord Tywin.
11796,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin May we have the room?
11797,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"ellaria Call my name if you need me, lover."
11798,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Would you like to sit?
11799,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin No, thank you."
11800,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Some wine?
11801,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn I'm sorry about your grandson.
11802,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Are you?
11803,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
11804,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Which way is that?
11805,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
11806,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Some believe the king choked.
11807,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
11808,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
11809,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn I did. This is why I know.
11810,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
11811,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
11812,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
11813,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn You think we conspired together?
11814,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin What did you discuss?
11815,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn The death of my sister.
11816,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin For which you blame me.
11817,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
11818,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
11819,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
11820,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
11821,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
11822,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin Categorically.
11823,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn I would like to speak with the Mountain.
11824,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
11825,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
11826,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin I could arrange for this meeting.
11827,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn But you want something in return.
11828,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
11829,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn Why?
11830,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
11831,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
11832,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
11833,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
11834,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
11835,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,oberyn You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
11836,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
11837,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
11838,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
11839,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion A noble effort.
11840,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
11841,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
11842,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I've heard nothing, my lord."
11843,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
11844,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
11845,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
11846,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick No, my lord. You didn't?"
11847,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
11848,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick Your father.
11849,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Of course.
11850,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick Mace Tyrell.
11851,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
11852,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
11853,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
11854,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
11855,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
11856,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick My lord, she's gone."
11857,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Gone?
11858,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
11859,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
11860,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick Yes, my lord?"
11861,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion They'll be following you now.
11862,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick Who will?
11863,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
11864,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick Any other witnesses, my lord?"
11865,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
11866,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
11867,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
11868,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
11869,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Why not?
11870,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
11871,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
11872,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I'll ask, my lord."
11873,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
11874,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
11875,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
11876,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Are you going to accept their offer?
11877,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick My lord.
11878,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
11879,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick You've been good to me, my lord."
11880,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
11881,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick I already gave them an answer, my lord."
11882,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
11883,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
11884,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick Farewell, my lord."
11885,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
11886,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,olly Mother says it's time to eat.
11887,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,guymon,guymon What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

11897,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,yarwyck,yarwyck Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.

11901,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,pyp There's got to be a way to protect them.
11902,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser,"alliser You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"

11904,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser,alliser We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.

11914,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous,dolorous They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
11915,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon,jon We need to ride north and kill them all.
11916,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser,"alliser We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
11917,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon,"jon It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
11918,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,pyp I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
11919,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,daenerys Are they attacking?
11920,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah,jorah A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
11921,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,daenerys What is he doing?
11922,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan,barristan I believe he means to...
11923,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,missandei,"missandei He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."

11925,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah,jorah They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
11926,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,"daenerys I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"

11928,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,daenerys You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.

11930,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,daenerys Which is why you must remain by my side.

11939,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys,daenerys Horses are faster than men.

11984,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
11985,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
11986,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
11987,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime You talk to my brother this way?
11988,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn All the time. He got used to it.
11989,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Do you think he did it?
11990,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"bronn No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
11991,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"bronn You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
11992,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime We're done for today.
11993,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
11994,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
11995,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
11996,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
11997,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion Is that supposed to make me feel better?
11998,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
11999,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12000,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12001,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion Her son?
12002,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Don't. You know what's coming?
12003,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12004,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12005,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12006,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Depends. Did you do it?
12007,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12008,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12009,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion Well, you could set me free."
12010,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime You know I can't.
12011,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion Then there's really nothing else to say.
12012,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12013,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12014,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12015,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion Except I didn't do it.
12016,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
12017,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12018,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12019,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12020,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa Where are you taking me?
12021,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12022,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa Did you kill Joffrey?
12023,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12024,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa I know it was you.
12025,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12026,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12027,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr Why not?
12028,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12029,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr Then perhaps it was your husband.
12030,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa No.
12031,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr How do you know?
12032,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa I just do.
12033,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12034,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12035,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12036,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12037,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12038,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa And what do you want?
12039,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12040,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa Who could trust you?
12041,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12042,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12043,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12044,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12045,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12046,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12047,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna How absentminded of me.
12048,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery Mm-hmm.
12049,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12050,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12051,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery Well, he could have done."
12052,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna He could have done,but he didn't."
12053,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery You don't know, Grandmother."
12054,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12055,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery What? I don't understand.
12056,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12057,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon Bring it through! And again.
12058,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon Very nice. Good.
12059,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12060,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon Let's see what you can do.
12061,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,"jon Olly, you just watch for now."

12065,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grenn,"grenn I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12066,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,"jon You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
12067,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12068,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12069,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12070,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon Grenn and I were helping them.

12072,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon Someone has to train them.
12073,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.

12077,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos,janos For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12078,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"locke A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12079,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.

12083,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12084,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,"alliser Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12085,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke Guess I was wrong.

12087,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12088,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12089,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12090,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12091,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12092,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime What?
12093,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12094,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12095,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei She hoped or did you promise?
12096,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12097,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12098,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12099,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,"cersei You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12100,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12101,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12102,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12103,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei And?
12104,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime He didn't do it, Cersei."
12105,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,"cersei You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."

12107,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,tommen How did you get past the Kingsguard?

12109,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,tommen I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12110,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12111,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12112,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,tommen Yes. But if my mother found out...
12113,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."

12118,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,tommen Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12119,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12120,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,tommen No. I don't think I am.
12121,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12122,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen,"tommen We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."

12126,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.

Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"

12217,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,tanner This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
12218,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"tanner You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
12219,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,tanner I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
12220,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"tanner See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."

12245,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,margaery He was my husband. My king.
12246,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei He would have been your nightmare.
12247,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,"margaery Your Grace, I feel..."
12248,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"

12250,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."

12252,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
12253,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,margaery He has you.
12254,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
12255,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,"margaery Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
12256,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
12257,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,margaery We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
12258,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery,margaery I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
12259,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
12260,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
12261,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,daario The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
12262,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys Who told you to take the Navy?
12263,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,daario No one.
12264,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys So why did you do it?
12265,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,daario I heard you liked ships.
12266,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys How many ships?
12267,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan Ninety-three, Your Grace."
12268,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys How many men can they carry?
12269,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
12270,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
12271,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah The Lannisters have more.
12272,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
12273,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
12274,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,barristan The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
12275,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,"jorah The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
12276,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,"jorah There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
12277,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,"daenerys Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
12278,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
12279,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
12280,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
12281,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
12282,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
12283,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
12284,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,"jorah What, then?"
12285,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys I will do what queens do. I will rule.
12286,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
12287,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa But how would they know?
12288,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
12289,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
12290,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
12291,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,knight Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
12292,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
12293,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,knight Stand to.

12302,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
12303,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
12304,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
12305,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa My flesh and blood.
12306,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
12307,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
12308,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa Of course. I understand.
12309,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
12310,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa I would never say a thing.
12311,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.

12313,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa They did, and my father's."
12314,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,"robin They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
12315,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa Make him fly?
12316,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,robin Through the Moon Door.
12317,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
12318,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
12319,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
12320,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa No. We never...
12321,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
12322,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
12323,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."

12325,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa What took you so long?
12326,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
12327,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
12328,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa Let's get married tonight.
12329,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
12330,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
12331,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr I do think that we could wait until...
12332,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
12333,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr Like it was yesterday.
12334,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
12335,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
12336,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr Tonight it is, then."
12337,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
12338,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
12339,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin When will the wedding take place in your mind?
12340,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
12341,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin A fortnight?
12342,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei That seems reasonable.
12343,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
12344,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin And your wedding to Loras?
12345,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Shortly after Tommen's.
12346,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Shortly?
12347,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei A fortnight.
12348,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
12349,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei We had that in common.
12350,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
12351,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Then whom can we trust?
12352,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Ourselves alone.
12353,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
12354,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Robert wasn't particularly rich.
12355,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
12356,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
12357,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
12358,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Haven't a clue.
12359,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin Go on, your best guess."
12360,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei Pounds, tons, ounces?"
12361,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
12362,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei That can't be.
12363,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
12364,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Then how do we pay for anything?
12365,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
12366,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei How much?
12367,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin A tremendous amount.
12368,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
12369,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
12370,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
12371,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
12372,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
12373,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
12374,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
12375,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
12376,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
12377,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,sandor Would you shut up?
12378,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya I can't sleep until I say the names.

12380,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya Only the ones I'm going to kill.
12381,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,"sandor Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
12382,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,"arya If he were here right now, what would you do?"
12383,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,"sandor I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
12384,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya I'm almost done. Only one name left.
12385,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,sandor Go on.

12390,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
12391,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
12392,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
12393,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
12394,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."

12396,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa He feels responsible for you.

12404,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
12405,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?

I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
12417,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.

12419,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"podrick Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
12420,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"brienne Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."

12428,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,brienne I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.

12796,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"varys Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
12797,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn Such as?
12798,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion Let me guess, I've been pardoned."

He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."

12830,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,"cersei Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
12831,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,"oberyn Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
12832,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,cersei I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.

12837,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.

12922,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
12923,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime You fell in love with a whore.
12924,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
12925,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
12926,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion At least I got to tell them what they really are.
12927,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,"jaime Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
12928,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
12929,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
12930,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
12931,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
12932,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime It is tempting.
12933,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
12934,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime If he wins.
12935,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
12936,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime No. Not Ser Meryn.
12937,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,"guard Go on, move it."
12938,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,guard And you. Come on.
12939,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,prisoner,"prisoner Mercy. Please. Please, mercy."
12940,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei,cersei Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
12941,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei,cersei You seem to be in good form.
12942,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mountain,mountain Who am I fighting?
12943,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei,cersei Does it matter?
12944,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor Could be food.
12945,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Could be soldiers.
12946,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
12947,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,"dying Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
12948,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor Who were ""they""?"
12949,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying I stopped asking a while ago.
12950,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor That's not gonna get better.
12951,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Doesn't seem so.
12952,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
12953,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
12954,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya So why go on?
12955,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Habit.
12956,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Nothing could be worse than this.
12957,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Maybe nothing is worse than this.
12958,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
12959,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Who are you?
12960,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
12961,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying You her father?
12962,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
12963,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,"dying A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
12964,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying Wish it were wine.
12965,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor So do I.
12966,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
12967,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor The fuck you doing?
12968,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge There's a price on your head.
12969,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
12970,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
12971,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
12972,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
12973,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
12974,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya He can't be. I don't know his name.
12975,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor What's your name?
12976,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge Rorge.
12977,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Thank you.
12978,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor You're learning.
12979,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man Rangers returning!
12980,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man They return!
12981,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon Greetings.
12982,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man Didn't think I'd see you again.
12983,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sam,"sam All right, Jon?"
12984,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,"man Welcome back, brother."
12985,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser Lord Snow.
12986,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
12987,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,"jon Come on, Ghost."
12988,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
12989,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,janos,"janos I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
12990,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon We need to prepare.
12991,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser We've been preparing.
12992,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
12993,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser And how would we range north?
12994,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon We wouldn't.
12995,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
12996,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,grenn,grenn We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
12997,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
12998,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,"jon Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
12999,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13000,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon They won't stop them.
13001,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13002,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon The stewards.
13003,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13004,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon No.
13005,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser Who would that be?
13006,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon The builders.
13007,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13008,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,yarwick No.
13009,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13010,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13011,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,yarwick Aye.
13012,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn My lord.
13013,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion You have new clothes.
13014,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13015,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I sent for you days ago.
13016,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn I've been a bit busy.
13017,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Doing what?
13018,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13019,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13020,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13021,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion She's dim-witted.
13022,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13023,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13024,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13025,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13026,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn Falyse is forty and barren.
13027,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13028,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13029,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13030,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13031,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13032,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13033,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13034,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13035,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13036,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13037,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13038,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13039,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13040,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Does he frighten you so much?
13041,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13042,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Because you're my friend.
13043,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13044,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13045,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I understand.
13046,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13047,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13048,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn We had some good days together.
13049,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, we did."
13050,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn What will you do?
13051,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13052,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13053,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13054,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario But your window is not.
13055,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13056,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Don't do that again.
13057,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13058,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13059,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13060,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Tell me why you're here.
13061,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13062,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13063,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13064,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13065,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario There is only one, and she does not want me."
13066,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys You swore me your sword.
13067,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario My sword is yours till the day I die.
13068,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13069,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13070,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Very well.
13071,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Do what you do best.
13072,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Take off your clothes.
13073,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse Oh.
13074,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre Come in, my queen. Please."
13075,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13076,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre You could never disturb me.
13077,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13078,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13079,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13080,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13081,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13082,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13083,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13084,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre Not always.
13085,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13086,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse Did you use it with Stannis?
13087,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13088,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13089,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13090,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre I understand how you feel.
13091,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse Hmm.
13092,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre But that is impossible.
13093,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse Why?
13094,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
13095,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13096,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13097,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah Khaleesi.
13098,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys You're here early.
13099,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah Later than some.
13100,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys You don't approve?
13101,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13102,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys You neither approve nor trust.
13103,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13104,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13105,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah I did.
13106,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys I trust you.
13107,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13108,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13109,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah You have?
13110,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys I have.
13111,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13112,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13113,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13114,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13115,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13116,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13117,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13118,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13119,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13120,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13121,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13122,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13123,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13124,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah Yes, Khaleesi."
13125,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys No. Tell him you changed my mind.
13126,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
13127,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,"arya You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13128,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor No fire.
13129,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13130,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor No fire!
13131,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13132,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13133,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13134,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Why?
13135,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13136,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13137,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13138,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13139,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13140,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick Yes, my lady."
13141,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne Don't get drunk.
13142,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick No, my lady."
13143,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot Can I get you anything else?
13144,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13145,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot Thanks. I do my best.
13146,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13147,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne No.
13148,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13149,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne We're looking for someone.
13150,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13151,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13152,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13153,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13154,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13155,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13156,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne What?
13157,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick It's nothing, my lady."
13158,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13159,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13160,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13161,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13162,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13163,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne What about? Not kidney pie.
13164,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13165,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13166,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13167,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne When was that?
13168,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13169,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne So what happened to her?
13170,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot Well-
13171,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne The quick version.
13172,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13173,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick The Hound.
13174,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13175,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne Um, you were saying?"
13176,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13177,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13178,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne Why the Eyrie?
13179,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13180,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne Sansa could be there, too."
13181,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick Aye, my lady. Could be."
13182,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne You sure about this?
13183,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick No.
13184,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13185,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13186,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13187,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn Your sister.
13188,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Oh.
13189,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13190,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13191,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13192,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13193,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13194,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion I think I would have remembered that.
13195,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13196,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13197,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13198,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion That would have made things so much easier.
13199,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13200,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13201,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13202,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13203,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn I disagree.
13204,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13205,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa Hello, Robin."
13206,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin What are you doing?
13207,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13208,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin Why did you leave?
13209,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa It's a long story.
13210,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13211,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa Yes, you certainly are."
13212,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin When will you go back?
13213,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13214,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13215,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13216,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13217,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa We don't.
13218,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?

13368,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
13369,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay I believe we will. To our new home.
13370,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
13371,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
13372,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
13373,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
13374,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr My lord...
13375,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
13376,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
13377,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
13378,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
13379,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
13380,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
13381,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
13382,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord We were told there was a witness. A girl.
13383,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady A niece of yours, I believe."
13384,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
13385,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord We'd like to speak with her.
13386,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr Let me fetch her.
13387,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
13388,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
13389,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr My lady...
13390,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady I wasn't asking you.

13392,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
13393,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
13394,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
13395,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
13396,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
13397,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."

13399,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
13400,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
13401,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
13402,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord Lady Sansa.
13403,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
13404,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
13405,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
13406,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
13407,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
13408,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
13409,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
13410,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
13411,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord Are you questioning our courage?
13412,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
13413,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
13414,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
13415,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
13416,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
13417,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
13418,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.

13420,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
13421,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord Aye, it's time."
13422,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."

13506,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor Aye, she'll pay."
13507,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya I've never even met her.
13508,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
13509,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya I'm not a lady.
13510,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,guard Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
13511,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
13512,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,guard Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
13513,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"robin I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
13514,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr You shouldn't be.
13515,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"robin The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
13516,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
13517,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa Shall we go?
13518,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
13519,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Soon.
13520,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
13521,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime I've never seen him fight.
13522,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
13523,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Oberyn believes in himself.
13524,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
13525,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Beheading.
13526,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
13527,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Cousins.
13528,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
13529,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
13530,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
13531,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,together,together Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
13532,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion Nothing made him happier.
13533,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
13534,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
13535,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,"jaime The joke wore thin, though."
13536,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion For you. You drifted away.
13537,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime I had other interests.
13538,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
13539,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Why?
13540,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
13541,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
13542,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
13543,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,"jaime Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
13544,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
13545,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime He was twice your size.
13546,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
13547,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime I don't know.
13548,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime Good luck today.
13549,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion Looks like very light armor.
13550,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn I like to move around.
13551,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
13552,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
13553,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
13554,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn Today is not the day I die.
13555,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,ellaria You're going to fight that?
13556,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn I'm going to kill that.
13557,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,ellaria He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
13558,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
13559,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion Thank the gods.

13562,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn Never.
13563,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn Have they told you who I am?
13564,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,mountain Some dead man.
13565,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
13566,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
13567,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
13568,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
13569,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn You raped her! You murdered her!
13570,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,oberyn You killed her children!
13571,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn,"oberyn Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
13572,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,mountain Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!

13574,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam What was she like?
13575,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon She...she had red hair.
13576,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam Oh? How big were her feet?
13577,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon Well what do you want me to say?
13578,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
13579,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon So you and Gilly never-
13580,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
13581,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,"jon But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
13582,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
13583,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon What?
13584,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
13585,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
13586,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
13587,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,"jon It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
13588,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam No, you're really not."
13589,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
13590,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
13591,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon,jon There will.
13592,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.

13594,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,tormund Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
13595,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte Yes.
13596,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,"tormund Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
13597,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
13598,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,tormund We could be waiting here a while.
13599,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
13600,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
13601,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
13602,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
13603,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte I probably killed him already.
13604,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr So you've said.
13605,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
13606,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
13607,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
13608,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr Maybe I have.
13609,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
13610,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
13611,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam Maester Aemon. How did you know-
13612,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
13613,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam Let me help you.
13614,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
13615,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam Maester Faull
13616,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
13617,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
13618,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
13619,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam I don't love her.
13620,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon Yes you do.
13621,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam No.
13622,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
13623,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam You were?
13624,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
13625,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
13626,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
13627,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam Who was she?
13628,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
13629,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"pyp I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"

13812,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"mance No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
13813,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,jon He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
13814,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,mance He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.

13822,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"mance I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
13823,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"mance Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
13824,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,mance You attacking us?
13825,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,"jon No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."

13830,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,mance Never had the pleasure.

13832,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,mance We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
13833,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis,stannis It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
13834,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,mance We do not kneel.

13841,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,"jon I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."

13843,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,"jon He was, your grace."
13844,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis,stannis What do you think he'd have done with him?
13845,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,"jon I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
13846,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis,stannis Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
13847,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon,"jon Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
13848,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,pycelle I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
13849,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei,cersei Bloody Martells.
13850,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,pycelle The cause appears to be manticore venom.
13851,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"qyburn It is, yes, manticore."
13852,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"pycelle I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."

13856,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"pycelle Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
13857,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,qyburn That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
13858,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"pycelle That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
13859,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei,"cersei You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
13860,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,pycelle Your grace. This is my laboratory!

One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."

14094,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin,tywin You shot me. You're no son of mine.
14095,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion,tyrion I am your son. I have always been your son.

14104,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,captain,"captain I'm not going north, child, we're going home."

14118,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,melara Are you sure?
14119,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei Yes.

14126,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
14127,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy You don't know what I am.
14128,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14129,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14130,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14131,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy Your blood. Give me a taste.
14132,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy Three questions you get. You won't like the answers.
14133,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14134,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
14135,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei But I will be queen?
14136,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"maggy Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14137,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei Will the king and I have children?
14138,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"maggy No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14139,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei That doesn't make sense.
14140,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14141,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,"melara Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"

14143,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14144,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"priest But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
14145,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,priest From all seven kingdoms…
14146,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei They will wait.
14147,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14148,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,"jaime What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
14149,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei They?
14150,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,jaime All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
14151,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
14152,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,jaime This is exactly what they want.
14153,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14154,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14155,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys Apologies.
14156,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14157,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."

A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14162,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion Much better.
14163,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys My lord?
14164,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14165,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14166,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion In a box. Why stop now?

14221,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14222,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon It's where she belonged.
14223,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14224,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
14225,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.

14230,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos It's a fair offer. More than fair.
14231,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.

14244,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,squire,squire My lord.
14245,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master,"master Sword up, my lord!"
14246,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
14247,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14248,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr He has other gifts.
14249,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce Does he?
14250,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
14251,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,"sansa Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
14252,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"royce I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
14253,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
14254,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"royce He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
14255,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"podrick Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
14256,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
14257,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick But I'm you're squire.
14258,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne Do you even know what a squire is?
14259,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick An attendant to a knight?
14260,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
14261,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"podrick Well, where would I go?"
14262,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,"brienne I don't care, I'm not your mother."
14263,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick You swore to find the Stark girls.
14264,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
14265,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick Sansa still might.
14266,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
14267,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
14268,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr I did.
14269,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa But we're heading west.
14270,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr We are.
14271,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,"sansa If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
14272,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
14273,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
14274,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
14275,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
14276,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
14277,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"loras It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
14278,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
14279,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei Thank you so much for your kind words.
14280,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grand,"grand Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
14281,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel Your grace.
14282,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
14283,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel My deepest sympathies.
14284,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,kevan I apologize for my son's appearance.
14285,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei Uncle, it's quite alright."
14286,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,"kevan They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
14287,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
14288,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,kevan Of course.
14289,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
14290,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
14291,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei What can I do for you?
14292,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel You can forgive me.
14293,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
14294,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel I led you into the darkness.
14295,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
14296,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"lancel I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
14297,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei I don't know what you're talking about.
14298,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"lancel I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."
14299,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
14300,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,olyvar It looks like Dorne.
14301,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras No it doesn't.
14302,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,olyvar It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
14303,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras Sandstone.
14304,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"olyvar Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
14305,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras Fine.
14306,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras It's Dorne.
14307,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,olyvar We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
14308,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"loras Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
14309,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery We're late for dinner as it is.
14310,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras You're very respectful.
14311,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery I'm very hungry.
14312,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery What's your name?
14313,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"olyvar Olyvar, my lady."
14314,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,"margaery I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
14315,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
14316,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
14317,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
14318,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
14319,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery Lucky you.
14320,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras Unlucky you.
14321,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery You think I want that woman married to my brother?
14322,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"loras If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
14323,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery Perhaps.
14324,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras Perhaps?
14325,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery Perhaps?
14326,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,"tyrion Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
14327,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys Imp, half-man."
14328,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys There are faster ways to kill yourself.
14329,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion Not for a coward.
14330,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
14331,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion You never told me why you set me free.
14332,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys Your brother asked me to.
14333,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion You could have said no.
14334,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
14335,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,"tyrion Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
14336,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
14337,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
14338,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
14339,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
14340,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
14341,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion I'm not well-suited for work.
14342,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
14343,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
14344,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys I never said you were perfect.
14345,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion What is it you want exactly?
14346,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
14347,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,"tyrion Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
14348,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
14349,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
14350,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
14351,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion Good luck finding him.
14352,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
14353,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
14354,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
14355,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
14356,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Good.
14357,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr They did ask for some concessions.
14358,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Concessions?
14359,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
14360,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
14361,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
14362,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,"daenerys I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
14363,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
14364,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
14365,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
14366,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
14367,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys No fighting pits.
14368,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
14369,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
14370,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr If you--
14371,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys How many times must I say no before you understand?
14372,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
14373,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario You should reopen the fighting pits.
14374,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys What?
14375,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
14376,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Why?
14377,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
14378,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,"daenerys You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
14379,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
14380,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
14381,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
14382,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
14383,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
14384,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
14385,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Viserion? Rhaegal?
14386,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys Easy. Easy. Easy.
14387,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance So here we are.
14388,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon Here we are.

14390,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
14391,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"mance No, but it will be."
14392,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon You know what Stannis wants?
14393,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
14394,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon Shouldn't a king be bold?
14395,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"mance Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
14396,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
14397,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
14398,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,"jon You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
14399,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
14400,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon Then bend the knee and save your people.
14401,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.
14402,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
14403,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"mance Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
14404,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon They'll burn you alive.
14405,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"mance Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe."
14406,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,"jon And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
14407,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"mance You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
14408,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon I think you're making a terrible mistake.
14409,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
14410,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,"stannis Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
14411,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis Kneel and live.
14412,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

14446,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne You sure?

14453,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,podrick We only have one horse.

14455,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr Do you like the taste?
14456,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa,sansa I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
14457,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr It gives some men courage.
14458,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa,sansa Does it give you courage?
14459,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,guard,guard That's far enough.
14460,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"brienne Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
14461,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,"petyr We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
14462,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"brienne Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
14463,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,"petyr Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
14464,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne I was.
14465,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
14466,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne It was after Renly's murder.
14467,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,"petyr Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
14468,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne I tried to save him.
14469,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr But you were accused.
14470,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne By men who didn't see what happened.
14471,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr Then what did happen?
14472,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
14473,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
14474,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne Why should you have any say in her affairs?
14475,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,"petyr Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
14476,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"brienne Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
14477,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa,sansa No.
14478,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"brienne Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
14479,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa,sansa I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
14480,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
14481,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa,sansa And sometimes we do. You should leave.
14482,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,petyr We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?

14493,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"brienne Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
14494,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"podrick My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow."
14495,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.

14538,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"bronn I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
14539,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,lollys Who's that?
14540,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn Jaime fucking Lannister.

14544,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime Thank you.
14545,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"bronn This is my betrothed, Lollys."
14546,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime A pleasure.
14547,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"bronn Run along, love."
14548,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
14549,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn Just get on with it.
14550,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime On with what?
14551,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
14552,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime It's very good for you.
14553,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
14554,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime Mmm.
14555,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"bronn We made a deal, your sister and I."
14556,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime I would have advised against that.
14557,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn How is this good for me?
14558,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,"jaime Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
14559,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,bronn Return from where?
14560,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime,jaime As far south as south goes.
14561,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,trystane,trystane My future queen.
14562,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,areo,areo The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
14563,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"ellaria Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
14564,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran Captain. Let her pass.
14565,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"ellaria Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
14566,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,"doran Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
14567,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria Your brother--
14568,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
14569,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria What will you do about his death.
14570,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
14571,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria You would have me go to war?
14572,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran You would have me go to war?
14573,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria The whole country would have you go to war.
14574,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
14575,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
14576,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"ellaria Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
14577,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
14578,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria And how long will that be?
14579,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
14580,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
14581,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
14582,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey,grey No one here. We go.
14583,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario In a hurry? You're afraid?
14584,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey,grey Unsullied fear nothing.
14585,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
14586,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario Fear is useful that way.
14587,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"mossador Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
14588,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys It would send a message.
14589,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
14590,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys Why?
14591,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan For one thing, he may have valuable information."
14592,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
14593,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan How do you know that?
14594,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario Because I questioned him.
14595,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"hizdahr And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
14596,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador He is born free.
14597,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,hizdahr Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
14598,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
14599,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
14600,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,hizdahr And how do you know this?
14601,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador Everyone knows this.
14602,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"hizdahr I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
14603,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
14604,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"mossador I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
14605,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys Thank you all for your counsel.
14606,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
14607,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys About what?
14608,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan About your father. About the Mad King.
14609,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
14610,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
14611,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys Go on.
14612,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
14613,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys I'm not my father.
14614,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
14615,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
14616,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan Your Grace.
14617,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion There's a bug.
14618,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
14619,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,"tyrion When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
14620,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys You don't like it?
14621,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion I want to take a walk.
14622,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
14623,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,"tyrion She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
14624,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
14625,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
14626,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys The road to Meereen.
14627,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
14628,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys I told you. A ruler.
14629,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
14630,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
14631,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion I didn't rule. I was a servant.
14632,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys Still, a man of talent."
14633,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion Managed to kill a lot of people.
14634,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
14635,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
14636,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys Why?
14637,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
14638,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
14639,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion I find us repulsive.
14640,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
14641,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion You're right. Let's go for a walk.
14642,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys No.
14643,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
14644,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei Not him.
14645,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,"meryn Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
14646,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
14647,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hunters,"hunters Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
14648,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei Take the head.
14649,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,"qyburn Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
14650,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei Very good.
14651,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,qyburn Over there will be fine.
14652,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,meryn You heard the man. Over there.
14653,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan You're the Hand of the King?
14654,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
14655,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
14656,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
14657,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace Oh, Your Grace."
14658,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
14659,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
14660,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"pycelle Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
14661,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
14662,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"pycelle Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
14663,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
14664,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,pycelle I must say I cannot see--
14665,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
14666,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
14667,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei The king is very busy at this moment.
14668,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"kevan He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
14669,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
14670,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
14671,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
14672,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan What mission?
14673,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei That is not your concern as Master of War.
14674,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
14675,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei You would abandon your king in his time of need?
14676,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"kevan If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."

14827,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen,tommen I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
14828,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery,margaery It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .

Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
14833,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,"cersei You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
14834,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen,tommen Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
14835,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
14836,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen,tommen That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
14837,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
14838,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen,"tommen The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
14839,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei This is my real home now. Where my family lives.

14855,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei There's no need for such formalities.
14856,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery,"margaery In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."

14858,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery,margaery Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.

14862,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"roose I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
14863,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,"ramsay Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."

14868,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
14869,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
14870,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,ramsay Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
14871,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"roose I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
14872,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa,sansa That's Moat Cailin.

Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
14892,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick How do we get through there?
14893,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne We don't. We go around. .
14894,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
14895,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
14896,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
14897,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick He hates that nickname.
14898,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
14899,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
14900,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne He borrowed it?
14901,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
14902,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne As punishment. For both of you.
14903,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
14904,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
14905,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
14906,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
14907,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
14908,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne You want to be a knight, Pod?"
14909,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick Yes.
14910,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
14911,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick Thank you.
14912,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
14913,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick I suppose that's more important.
14914,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
14915,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne I was.
14916,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
14917,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne He was.
14918,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick But how did you end up serving Renly?
14919,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
14920,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
14921,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
14922,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
14923,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
14924,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis Lord Commander.
14925,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon Your Grace.
14926,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis I'd like to speak alone.

14929,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
14930,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis Say the word and you will be.
14931,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
14932,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
14933,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,"jon I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
14934,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
14935,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon I can imagine no higher praise.
14936,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,"stannis I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."

14938,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis Are you bored of us already?
14939,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
14940,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
14941,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon And the wildlings?
14942,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,"stannis They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
14943,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,"jon Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
14944,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
14945,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
14946,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
14947,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

14950,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
14951,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon As long as he's ruling them.
14952,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
14953,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
14954,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
14959,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon And what needs to be done?

15293,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon,jon I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

15310,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"shireen Are you ashamed of me, father?"
15311,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis,"stannis When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."

15314,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr,"petyr I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
15315,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa,"sansa Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."

15330,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr,"petyr He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."

15417,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion,tyrion What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
15418,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah,jorah What business would you have with the Queen?
15419,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion,"tyrion Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
15420,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys,daenerys Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?

15425,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,barristan Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
15426,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys,daenerys And what did you do?
15427,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,barristan I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.

15431,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,barristan Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
15432,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys,daenerys And what did you do with the money?
15433,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"barristan Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. ."

Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
15444,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys,daenerys Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
15445,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,hizdahr,"hizdahr Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."

15453,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys,daenerys I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.

15480,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund Hard to lead when you're in chains.
15481,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon,jon What if I unchained you?
15482,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund Why would you do that?
15483,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon,jon Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.

15493,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon,jon I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
15494,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.

Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
15496,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
15497,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon,jon Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less.

15510,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,man And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.

15619,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay And if it's a boy?
15620,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose You're worried about your position.
15621,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
15622,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose You've never asked me about your mother.
15623,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
15624,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"roose She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
15625,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay Yes.

15631,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
15632,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly Where's that?
15633,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam The Citadel? In Oldtown.

15637,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam Well -
15638,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
15639,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam It's where they train the maesters.
15640,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly Like Maester Aemon?
15641,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."

15649,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis Dragonglass?
15650,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam What the maesters call obsidian -
15651,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
15652,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
15653,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.

15659,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."

15774,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,tyrion I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
15775,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah,jorah Why?
15776,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,tyrion Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.

15778,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,tyrion I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.

15795,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,"tyrion Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."

15800,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah,"jorah Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
15801,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah,jorah It's hard to be a cynic after that.

Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
15807,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah,jorah Then she rules.
15808,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,tyrion So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
15809,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah,jorah She is the rightful heir.
15810,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion,"tyrion Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"

15847,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,"lancel Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
15848,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
15849,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
15850,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
15851,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
15852,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
15853,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
15854,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
15855,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
15856,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
15857,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
15858,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
15859,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
15860,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
15861,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
15862,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei Good. If there's nothing else.
15863,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
15864,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei That's not possible.
15865,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
15866,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
15867,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
15868,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei We were fools to trust a turncloak.
15869,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
15870,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
15871,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr I would counsel patience, your grace."
15872,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
15873,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
15874,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
15875,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
15876,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
15877,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr Ser Jaime, then."
15878,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
15879,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
15880,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
15881,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,"petyr You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
15882,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei And if you succeed?
15883,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr Name me Warden of the North.
15884,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
15885,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
15886,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
15887,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr As I said. I live to serve.

15890,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,trystane He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
15891,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"myrcella Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
15892,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,myrcella We can't. Not yet.

15897,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,trystane I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
15898,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"myrcella They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
15899,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,doran They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.

15901,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,doran You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.

15903,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,bronn The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
15904,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime,"jaime Alright, thats enough."

15911,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime,jaime I like to improvise.

15941,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,"olenna Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."

15956,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
15957,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
15958,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,"olenna Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"

15963,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
15964,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
15965,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."

15971,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,loras I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.

15980,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna Well I think that's quite enough of that.
15981,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

16228,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow The people always do the dirty work.
16229,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."

16237,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
16238,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?

16244,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
16245,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell?

16287,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
16288,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn Was I?
16289,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
16290,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
16291,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene How's your arm now?
16292,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
16293,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene And how about your head?
16294,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
16295,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene Your nose is bleeding.
16296,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn It's nothing. It's the dry air.
16297,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,"tyene My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
16298,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
16299,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene Sorry? Who?
16300,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn You.
16301,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene Don't drop it.
16302,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene I think you're very handsome as well.
16303,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr I'm sorry about the locale.
16304,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna No you're not.
16305,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr It felt like the safest place.
16306,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna Not for your clientele, clearly."
16307,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,"petyr It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
16308,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
16309,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
16310,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
16311,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr I promise you..
16312,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
16313,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
16314,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna And what did she want?
16315,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,"petyr A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
16316,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna What kind of gift?
16317,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
16318,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,slave,"slave Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
16319,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"owner You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
16320,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner Valar morghulis.

16322,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner Prepare yourselves.
16323,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
16324,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
16325,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner Move yourselves!
16326,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
16327,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"owner We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16328,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,"men We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16329,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys I think I've seen enough.
16330,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
16331,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
16332,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,tyrion What are you doing?
16333,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys Get him out of my sight.
16334,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jorah,"jorah Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
16335,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,tyrion It's true. He has.
16336,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys Who are you?
16337,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,"tyrion I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
16338,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
16339,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery I know you did this.
16340,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
16341,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,"margaery Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
16342,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
16343,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery I don't want to see you again.
16344,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
16345,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery Leave.
16346,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
16347,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery Get out you hateful bitch!
16348,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei Sleep well, sister."
16349,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Thank you. You saw her?
16350,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Yes.
16351,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow And?
16352,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
16353,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
16354,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Who will stand judge?
16355,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
16356,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Will you be one of them?
16357,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow I will.
16358,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
16359,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
16360,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei What does The Mother's mercy entail?
16361,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
16362,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
16363,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
16364,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei I think I may have heard at one point.
16365,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
16366,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow Who carved this altar do you know?
16367,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei I'm afraid i don't.
16368,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
16369,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
16370,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow And he has much to say about you.
16371,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Move. Let me go immediately.
16372,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
16373,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
16374,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,end,end EPISODE
16375,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,"jorah Your Grace, I want to say--"
16376,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
16377,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion If only I were otherwise.
16378,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
16379,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
16380,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
16381,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
16382,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
16383,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
16384,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
16385,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
16386,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I have a very large army and very large dragons.
16387,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
16388,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
16389,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion I know.
16390,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
16391,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
16392,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
16393,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,"daenerys Yes, many opportunities."
16394,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion And did he?
16395,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys No. Not until forced to do so.
16396,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
16397,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys So I should kill him?
16398,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
16399,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
16400,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa Confess.
16401,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei My son. Let me speak to--
16402,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa Confess. I meant it.
16403,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei My face will be the last thing you see before--
16404,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
16405,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
16406,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
16407,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
16408,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya How will she serve him?
16409,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
16410,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya What will she do there?
16411,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen She will see.
16412,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya See what?
16413,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
16414,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya Oysters, clams and cockles!"
16415,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!

16417,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya Best in the city.

16419,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
16420,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
16421,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin Can't do it.
16422,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,"man Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
16423,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
16424,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
16425,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen A girl tells a man that she has seen.
16426,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
16427,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
16428,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
16429,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
16430,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya And then what?

16432,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif She is not ready.
16433,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
16434,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif And if she's not?
16435,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
16436,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
16437,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei The charges?
16438,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
16439,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei All lies.
16440,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
16441,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
16442,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
16443,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei Tell him I need to speak to him.
16444,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn I implored him to visit you but he would not.
16445,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
16446,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
16447,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
16448,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
16449,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei I can't stay here.
16450,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
16451,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
16452,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
16453,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa Why. Why Theon.
16454,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
16455,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
16456,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
16457,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
16458,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
16459,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
16460,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon They weren't. They were only--
16461,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa Only what?
16462,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon I can't..
16463,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa Tell me!
16464,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon I can't, not unless the master says..."
16465,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Tell me, they weren't what?!"
16466,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon They weren't...
16467,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
16468,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
16469,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa You didn't…?
16470,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
16471,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon I can't talk to you anymore.
16472,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
16473,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon Not Theon, Reek!"
16474,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton,"bolton Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
16475,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,"roose And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
16476,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose You disagree?
16477,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,"ramsay Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
16478,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose And what do you recommend?
16479,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,"ramsay That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
16480,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
16481,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,ramsay I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
16482,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
16483,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
16484,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys It's probably my safest option.
16485,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
16486,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys And what would your father do?
16487,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
16488,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Is that why you killed him?
16489,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
16490,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
16491,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
16492,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I'm terrible?
16493,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion I've heard stories.
16494,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
16495,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
16496,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Which kind is that?
16497,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
16498,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
16499,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
16500,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Perhaps it won't come to that.
16501,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
16502,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Varys? King Robert's spy master?
16503,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
16504,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
16505,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
16506,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys But you trust him?
16507,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
16508,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys The brother who killed my father.
16509,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion That's the one.
16510,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
16511,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
16512,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I'm not going to kill you.
16513,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion No? Banish me?
16514,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys No.
16515,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
16516,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
16517,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion Advise you on what?
16518,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys How to get what I want.
16519,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
16520,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
16521,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
16522,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
16523,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
16524,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys The common people.
16525,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
16526,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,"daenerys Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
16527,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
16528,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
16529,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
16530,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,master You struck me.
16531,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
16532,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,"master You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
16533,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
16534,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa Thirsty? Confess.
16535,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
16536,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
16537,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
16538,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly Does it hurt?
16539,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam No.
16540,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly Good.
16541,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam How are you?
16542,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
16543,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam You know what I mean.
16544,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly I'm good.
16545,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Are you scared?
16546,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly A little.
16547,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Me too.
16548,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Who's there?
16549,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly Olly.
16550,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Come in.
16551,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly I heard what happened.
16552,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
16553,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly Figured you were hungry.
16554,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam You're a good lad.
16555,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
16556,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly I need to check on baby Sam.
16557,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Now then. How can I help?
16558,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly It's about the Lord Commander.
16559,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Yes?
16560,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
16561,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam We've been fighting them for years.
16562,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
16563,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
16564,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,"olly The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
16565,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Olly...
16566,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly How can he trust him?
16567,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
16568,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
16569,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
16570,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly You believe that?
16571,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam With all my heart.
16572,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
16573,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund You trust me Jon Snow?
16574,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon Does that make me a fool?
16575,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund We are fools together now.
16576,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
16577,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
16578,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund War.
16579,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
16580,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
16581,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord You don't give the orders here.
16582,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund I'm not giving an order.
16583,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord Why aren't you in chains?
16584,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon He's not my prisoner.
16585,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord What is he?
16586,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon We're allies.
16587,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
16588,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund I don't fight for the crows.
16589,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
16590,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,"lord Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
16591,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund Gather the elders and let's talk.
16592,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
16593,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi You built that wall to keep us out.
16594,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
16595,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
16596,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
16597,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
16598,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
16599,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda You saw this?
16600,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon No. But I trust the man.
16601,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi There are old stories about Dragonglass.
16602,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
16603,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
16604,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
16605,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi Come with you where?
16606,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
16607,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,"jon I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
16608,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi If…?
16609,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
16610,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda Where is Mance?
16611,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon He died.
16612,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda How?
16613,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon I put an arrow through his heart.
16614,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
16615,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
16616,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
16617,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,"jon I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
16618,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
16619,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
16620,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
16621,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
16622,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund This is the way.
16623,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wildling,wildling I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
16624,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,giant,giant Tormund.
16625,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"loboda Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
16626,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi I fucking hate Thenns.
16627,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon How many are with us? 5000?
16628,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund I'm not good at counting.
16629,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon We're leaving too many behind.
16630,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
16631,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon And he knew them better than I ever will.
16632,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
16633,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."
16634,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daughter,daughter I wanna go with you.
16635,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on."
16636,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wun,wun Lokh kif rukh?
16637,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda Shut the gate.

16647,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon You should be on one of those boats.
16648,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?
16649,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon You have my word. I've given orders.
16650,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !
16651,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund If they get through, everyone dies !"
16652,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!

16656,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,edd,edd Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.
16657,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon Go! Go! Go!
16658,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund Wun Wun, to the sea."

16661,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
16662,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis Horses?
16663,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
16664,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
16665,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
16666,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
16667,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
16668,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis We're not returning to Castle Black.
16669,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
16670,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
16671,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,alliser Open the gates.
16672,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon,jon It was a failure.
16673,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,sam It wasn't.
16674,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon,"jon I went to save them, I failed."
16675,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,"sam You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
16676,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon,jon I don't think that fact's lost on them.
16677,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,"alliser You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
16678,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos You sent for me, Your Grace."
16679,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
16680,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Your Grace, you've named me your Hand."
16681,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis Yes.
16682,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
16683,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
16684,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
16685,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
16686,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
16687,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis My family stays with me.
16688,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
16689,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos What's this one now?
16690,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen The Dance of Dragons
16691,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos Well that sounds like a proper story.
16692,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
16693,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
16694,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen And burnt him to a crisp.
16695,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
16696,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos Do you like it?
16697,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen He's beautiful.
16698,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen Thank you.
16699,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos You're very welcome.
16700,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
16701,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,davos Of course I will.
16702,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen But why am I getting a present?
16703,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"davos Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
16704,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen You'll just have to read it yourself.
16705,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime Prince Doran.
16706,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
16707,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime Princess Myrcella.
16708,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,myrcella Uncle.
16709,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime What a lovely dress.
16710,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,myrcella You don't like it?
16711,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime You must be cold.
16712,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,myrcella Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
16713,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
16714,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,trystane A fleabite.
16715,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria What are you doing in Dorne?
16716,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,"jaime Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
16717,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,doran And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
16718,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
16719,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,myrcella That necklace was stolen from my room.
16720,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
16721,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,doran We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
16722,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"ellaria No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
16723,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
16724,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,doran King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?
16725,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime I'm afraid he does.
16726,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
16727,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime I accept.
16728,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
16729,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime You have my word.
16730,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria The word of a Kingslayer.
16731,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
16732,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't."
16733,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime May I inquire into the fate of my man?
16734,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"doran Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
16735,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
16736,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,doran Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.

16767,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.

16773,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
16774,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker Most unfortunate for the glovers.
16775,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."

16777,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
16778,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
16779,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
16780,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker I don't have that gift.

16817,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
16818,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria He didn't try to make you pay?
16819,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
16820,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,jaime She will.
16821,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"ellaria You love her very much, don't you?"
16822,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime,"jaime Of course, she's my niece."
16823,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria I wasn't talking about her.
16824,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"ellaria You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
16825,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
16826,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen Father. Aren't you cold?
16827,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis No. What are you reading?
16828,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen The Dance of Dragons.
16829,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis What's it about?
16830,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
16831,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
16832,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen That's just what they call it.
16833,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis Doesn't make much sense.
16834,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen I think it's poetic.
16835,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
16836,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
16837,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
16838,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen It's alright, father."
16839,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis You don't even know what I'm talking about.
16840,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
16841,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis Yes there is.
16842,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter."

16853,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,selyse I can't.
16854,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,stannis There's no other way. She has King's blood.

16867,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys I'm not putting my money anywhere.
16868,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
16869,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,daario People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
16870,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"hizdahr I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
16871,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,"daenerys Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
16872,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"daario Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
16873,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr You don't approve?
16874,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion,tyrion There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
16875,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"hizdahr Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
16876,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion,tyrion It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
16877,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
16878,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys That is greatness?
16879,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
16880,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion,tyrion My father would have liked you.
16881,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,announcer We ask again
16882,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
16883,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr At your command?
16884,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys If need be.
16885,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,announcer A Meereenese champion?
16886,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr How many people will die to make this happen?
16887,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.

16923,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon,jon I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.

16928,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
16929,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon,jon Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
16930,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

16936,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"sam I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
16937,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"sam If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."

16967,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,"myranda Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
16968,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,myranda You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.

The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."

17041,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17042,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion You betrayed her!
17043,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah Careful now.
17044,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,"tyrion And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
17045,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah The second time thanks to you.
17046,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,"tyrion Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
17047,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her."
17048,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,"tyrion Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
17049,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
17050,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
17051,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion Pardon me?
17052,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
17053,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,"tyrion Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
17054,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario Can you fight?
17055,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
17056,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario Are you good on a horse?
17057,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion Middling.
17058,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario So mainly you talk?
17059,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion And drink. I've survived so far.
17060,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17061,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17062,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17063,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey,grey I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
17064,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,missandei You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17065,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey,grey I am.
17066,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17067,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,"missandei It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17068,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17069,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,voice,"voice Hello, old friend."
17070,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,varys I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17071,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
17072,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"varys The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17073,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,"tyrion Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17074,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,varys Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17075,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17076,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"varys If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17077,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion I did miss you.
17078,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"varys Oh, I know."

17081,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys,daenerys How far did you carry me?
17082,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys,"daenerys Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17083,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys,"daenerys Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17084,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,septa,septa Confess. Confess.
17085,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei,"cersei I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"

17103,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,sparrow There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
17104,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei,"cersei A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
17105,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"sparrow Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."

17107,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,sparrow To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

17747,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"varys That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
17748,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,vala The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
17749,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"varys I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
17750,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,"vala Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son"

17754,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,varys Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
17755,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion,"tyrion What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"

17997,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yohn,yohn Do you take me for a fool?
17998,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,"petyr Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else"
17999,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yohn,"yohn Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him"
18000,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,petyr Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
18001,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,robin,robin Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
18002,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yohn,"yohn My lord My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
18003,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,robin,"robin Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
18004,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,"petyr Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"

18006,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,petyr I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?
18007,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,robin,robin Fine
18008,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,"petyr I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her"
18009,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,robin,robin She's my cousin We should help her
18010,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,petyr That was my instinct as well
18011,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr,petyr Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
18012,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey You invite the enemy into our city?
18013,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18014,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey I don't make peace with the queen's enemies I kill the queen's enemies
18015,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach"
18016,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her
18017,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
18018,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei How many days were you a slave?
18019,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Long enough to know
18020,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei Not long enough to understand
18021,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,yezzan I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It's most impressive
18022,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune
18023,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,razdal,razdal We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
18024,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
18025,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,belicho,belicho We want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
18026,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
18027,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,razdal,"razdal When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them"
18028,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,"missandei She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains"
18029,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,razdal,razdal As they have since the dawn of time
18030,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey Not anymore
18031,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,yezzan You think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master
18032,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Friends, friends, friends, please"
18033,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world
18034,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,yezzan Slavery is the way of our world
18035,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order
18036,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,yezzan What does that mean?
18037,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
18038,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"
18039,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,yezzan We do not support the Sons of the Harpy
18040,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer"
18041,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
18042,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before
18043,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time
18044,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei Perhaps I should translate for you
18045,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man We speak the Common Tongue
18046,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Excellent
18047,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man You met with the slavers today
18048,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion I did
18049,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them
18050,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
18051,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
18052,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
18053,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
18054,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man When does she return?
18055,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Soon You have my word
18056,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man We don't know you We don't trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him
18057,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,"tyrion And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace"
18058,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,man You have made peace with the slavers?
18059,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion We offered terms
18060,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,"man And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"
18061,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,"grey I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it"
18062,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,"man Missandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?"
18063,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei I do not trust them I will never trust them
18064,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,"missandei But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18065,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey Do not use me for your lies
18066,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion Those men respect you
18067,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal
18068,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion As do I
18069,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,"grey I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy"
18070,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
18071,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
18072,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion For a short time
18073,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,missandei Seven years is not a short time for a slave
18074,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
18075,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey You are wrong to trust these men
18076,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
18077,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
18078,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion,tyrion They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
18079,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey,grey You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
18080,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daario,daario You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

18147,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,"margaery I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family"
18148,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"sparrow Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair"

18154,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"sparrow Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was"
18155,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery So what did you do?
18156,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,sparrow I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
18157,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"sparrow Come, let's go and see him"

18161,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery Loras. Loras.
18162,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
18163,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
18164,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,loras I can't stay strong. I never was strong.
18165,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,"margaery You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
18166,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,loras I don't care about that.
18167,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?
18168,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,loras I just want it to stop. Help me.
18169,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,"margaery They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
18170,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,loras Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
18171,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,loras begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
18172,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery,margaery All right.
18173,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
18174,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,"maester And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
18175,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei enters the room
18176,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei What are you doing here?
18177,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,maester I am advising the king on our current predicament.
18178,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei Leave.
18179,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,maester I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --
18180,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei Is this a Small Council meeting?
18181,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,maester Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
18182,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,"tommen Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
18183,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,maester Your Grace.
18184,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,"maester PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
18185,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,"cersei Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
18186,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,tommen I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
18187,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,"cersei As have we all, unfortunately."
18188,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,tommen We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.
18189,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
18190,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
18191,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,"tommen You don't like Margaery, do you?"
18192,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,"cersei Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
18193,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,tommen Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
18194,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei You've spoken with him?
18195,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen,tommen I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
18196,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,"cersei It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
18197,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,kevan and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
18198,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
18199,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevin,kevin and LADY OLENNA stand up.
18200,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady,lady I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.
18201,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
18202,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady,"lady My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"
18203,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime,jaime Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
18204,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,"cersei The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
18205,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady,"lady Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
18206,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei I agree.
18207,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime,"jaime You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
18208,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,kevan The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
18209,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime,"jaime You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
18210,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"kevan No, but if the king should call on me --"
18211,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime,"jaime The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
18212,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
18213,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,kevan Of course I want him back.
18214,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
18215,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"kevan If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die."
18216,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady,lady Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
18217,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
18218,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,"yara They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
18219,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I escaped.
18220,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara I can't hear you.
18221,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
18222,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I'm sorry.
18223,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,"yara You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
18224,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I know. I know and I'm sorry.
18225,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara Stop saying that.
18226,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
18227,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara I know.
18228,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon You don't know.
18229,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara He send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.
18230,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara Why did you come here?
18231,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon Where else could I go?
18232,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?
18233,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,"theon No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
18234,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
18235,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I didn't know.
18236,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?
18237,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I don't want to be king.
18238,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara What do you want?
18239,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
18240,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara,yara That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.
18241,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon,theon You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
18242,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
18243,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
18244,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha A lord?

18246,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha The flayed man.
18247,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay Does that worry you at all?
18248,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha You eat them after?
18249,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay No.
18250,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha Then I've seen worse.
18251,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
18252,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay You served the Starks?
18253,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"osha Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
18254,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,"ramsay The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon."
18255,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"osha He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed."
18256,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,"ramsay Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"

18258,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay Are you sure you know what that is?
18259,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.

18262,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay I like that.

18264,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,osha That so?
18265,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,ramsay I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
18266,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay,"ramsay He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it."

18457,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Explains why you think a woman can be king.
18458,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,"yara When did you return, Uncle?"
18459,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
18460,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
18461,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
18462,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon,"theon That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
18463,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
18464,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
18465,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon,theon You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
18466,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron And how will she do that?
18467,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
18468,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,"euron Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
18469,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
18470,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
18471,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"aeron May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
18472,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aerson,aerson Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
18473,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

18477,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
18478,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron They stole our best ships.
18479,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Won't be enough to save them.
18480,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
18481,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
18482,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah You must send me away.
18483,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys Is there a cure?
18484,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah I don't know.
18485,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys How long does it take?
18486,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
18487,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
18488,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,"jorah Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
18489,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,"daenerys Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
18490,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
18491,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,"daenerys Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
18492,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
18493,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey,grey None.
18494,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.

18496,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
18497,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey,grey For now.
18498,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys For now is the best we get in our profession.
18499,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion It's not enough.
18500,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
18501,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,"tyrion It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
18502,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,missandei,missandei The people know who brought them freedom.
18503,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
18504,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
18505,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion Who said anything about “him”?
18506,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"man You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
18507,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion Welcome to Meereen.
18508,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
18509,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
18510,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
18511,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
18512,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
18513,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion Yes.
18514,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
18515,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion She did indeed.
18516,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
18517,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
18518,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
18519,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion I'd settle for obeyed.
18520,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
18521,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion That sounds most excellent --
18522,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
18523,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
18524,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
18525,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
18526,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
18527,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,"tyrion My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
18528,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
18529,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
18530,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."

18573,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"brienne Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"

The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
18629,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
18630,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly That's not any better being a nervous mute.
18631,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
18632,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.

18635,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly What did you tell your family about me?
18636,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam I told them I met you in the North.

18638,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
18639,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
18640,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
18641,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly I think we're here.

18658,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,melessa They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.

18660,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen Is there no other way?
18661,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow You're afraid for her?
18662,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
18663,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
18664,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
18665,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
18666,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
18667,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,"margaery No, Your Grace."
18668,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen I've missed you. More than you could know.
18669,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,margaery We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
18670,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.
18671,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,"margaery Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
18672,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,"tommen Yes, a few times. Have you?"
18673,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,"margaery Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
18674,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,margaery You think I'm mad. I sound mad.
18675,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,"tommen No. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -"
18676,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,margaery He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
18677,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
18678,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
18679,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,"margaery Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
18680,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen I don't understand.
18681,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,margaery It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
18682,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen,tommen What about Loras?
18683,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery,"margaery I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
18684,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly It's hard to walk in this.
18685,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
18686,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
18687,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,"dickon Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
18688,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
18689,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
18690,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Oh, that's a fair distance."
18691,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
18692,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
18693,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
18694,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
18695,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"melessa I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
18696,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,talla Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
18697,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll That's enough of that.
18698,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"melessa Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
18699,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
18700,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll Not fat enough already?
18701,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
18702,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll I read your letter. You're to be a maester.
18703,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
18704,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
18705,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
18706,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"melessa Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
18707,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
18708,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon There's no such thing.
18709,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
18710,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?
18711,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly The Night's Watch came to our keep.
18712,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll Where?

18715,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,randyll North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
18716,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,"randyll It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
18717,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"melessa Come, my dear. Talla."

18783,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya,arya The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.

And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
18863,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime,jaime You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.

18899,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys,daenerys I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?

18912,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor Just one.
18913,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
18914,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor He was a woman.
18915,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
18916,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor I'm used to it.
18917,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."

18919,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor Hate.

18922,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet."
18923,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"sandor I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
18924,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods."
18925,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor You're in the wrong line of work.
18926,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
18927,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.
18928,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray I've heard stories.
18929,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?
18930,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray They have.
18931,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,sparrow Your Grace. What are we reading today?
18932,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
18933,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
18934,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
18935,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
18936,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
18937,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,sparrow They are hard to love.
18938,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume."
18939,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,sparrow Can I ask you about a personal matter?
18940,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery Of course.
18941,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed."
18942,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery No.
18943,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
18944,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
18945,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
18946,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
18947,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,sparrow Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
18948,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery My grandmother?
18949,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
18950,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
18951,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
18952,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna Oh, this is madness!"
18953,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."

18955,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
18956,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery Grandmother, please."
18957,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna What have they done to you?
18958,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
18959,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna We marched for you.
18960,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy."
18961,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
18962,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
18963,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna Have you lost your mind?
18964,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery and live his life as a penitent.

18966,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery He can begin again.
18967,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna As a mindless fanatic.
18968,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery As a free man.
18969,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
18970,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
18971,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
18972,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna I will never leave you. Never.
18973,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery You must.

18978,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery Shall we pray?
18979,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim,"dim We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
18980,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"tormund If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
18981,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim,"dim Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
18982,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
18983,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"tormund The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."

18986,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"tormund We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
18987,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
18988,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna That is hardly your concern.
18989,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
18990,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
18991,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
18992,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna Good.
18993,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
18994,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
18995,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
18996,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
18997,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei Never. I'll never leave my son.
18998,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
18999,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man Pick the pace up. Keep going.
19000,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man Keep it moving!
19001,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19002,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime Someone certainly does.
19003,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
19004,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
19005,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn Aye, knights don't get paid."
19006,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19007,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19008,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19009,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19010,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19011,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

19041,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19042,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19043,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
19044,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19045,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19046,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
19047,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."

19049,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19050,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19051,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?

19056,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19057,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
19058,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna Go on, Ser Davos."
19059,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19060,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna Is this true?
19061,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.

You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19063,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."

19077,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19078,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.

19080,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19081,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19082,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19083,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19084,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19085,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."

19102,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"robett Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
19103,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours.

19173,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."

19175,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray I'm done with fighting.

19178,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"sandor You don't cure it by dying, either."
19179,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
19180,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor It's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.

But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
19194,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya You're good at that. Where did you learn?
19195,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady,lady I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
19196,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady,"lady So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."

19243,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys Would you?

19247,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"varys If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."

19254,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion Most of all, we need our queen."
19255,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
19256,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

19292,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn You must have shown it to her by now.

19297,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
19298,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
19299,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn All right, let's start with your footwork."

19303,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
19304,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Why would you assume that?
19305,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
19306,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne I don't think you know many girls like her.
19307,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
19308,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
19309,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne I've come for the Blackfish.

19315,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
19316,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
19317,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
19318,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Exactly.
19319,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime We shouldn't argue about politics.
19320,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
19321,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
19322,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
19323,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime What do you propose?
19324,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
19325,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
19326,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
19327,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Have you ever met the Blackfish?
19328,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne No.
19329,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime He's even more stubborn than you are.
19330,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
19331,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
19332,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime You have my word. You have until nightfall.
19333,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
19334,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime It's yours. It will always be yours.
19335,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne one last thing, Ser Jaime."
19336,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime Yes, Lady Brienne?"
19337,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
19338,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Of course it does.
19339,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne To fight you.
19340,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
19341,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden I've said no three times already.
19342,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
19343,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
19344,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden Double the guards tonight.
19345,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bryndel,bryndel The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
19346,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne As I have said, my name is- -"
19347,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
19348,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne He always spoke highly of you.
19349,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
19350,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
19351,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
19352,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
19353,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne He's not my friend.
19354,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden No?
19355,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
19356,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
19357,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden She's exactly like her mother.
19358,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
19359,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne You have more than she does.
19360,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
19361,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
19362,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick What should I write?
19363,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Tell her I failed.
19364,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei There's to be a royal announcement?
19365,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan There is.
19366,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei Why wasn't I informed?
19367,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
19368,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan Where are you going?
19369,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei To stand by my son.
19370,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
19371,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen,"tommen Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
19372,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen,"tommen Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
19373,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crowd,crowd Seven blessings.
19374,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
19375,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
19376,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn More. Much more.
19377,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei You seem happy.
19378,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
19379,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Now it's like a man reborn.
19380,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei I will be happy when our queen returns.
19381,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
19382,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey Unsullied never drink.
19383,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Why not?

19385,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion And who made these rules? Your former masters?
19386,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
19387,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion And you? What's your excuse?
19388,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
19389,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion That's how you know it's working.
19390,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
19391,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
19392,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey Long may she reign.
19393,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Do you like it?
19394,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey Tastes like it has turned.
19395,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
19396,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
19397,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei I do not know any jokes.
19398,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Grey worm?
19399,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
19400,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
19401,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion It's funnier in Westeros.
19402,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,"grey The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
19403,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Yes.
19404,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"missandei A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
19405,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
19406,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion Missandei, do you like the wine?"
19407,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei I do.
19408,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion Tell a joke.
19409,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei Two translators are on a sinking ship.

19412,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey That is the worst joke I ever heard.
19413,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei You don't even know what a joke is.
19414,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
19415,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion You lied to us.
19416,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey I make joke.

19418,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
19419,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei The Masters have come for their property.
19420,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Lord Edmure.
19421,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
19422,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure I have your word?
19423,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
19424,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
19425,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
19426,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
19427,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
19428,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
19429,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
19430,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
19431,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
19432,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
19433,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
19434,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
19435,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
19436,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure Yeah. She should have killed you.
19437,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
19438,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
19439,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
19440,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure Oh. Oh, I see. You're a madman."
19441,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -

19445,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime They'd do anything to protect their babies.
19446,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
19447,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
19448,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
19449,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."

19474,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden I've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.
19475,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
19476,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
19477,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden Go on, now."
19478,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden I haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
19479,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"guard We found the Blackfish, my lord."
19480,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime Good. Bring him to me.
19481,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"guard He died fighting, my lord."
19482,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion I was wrong. I admit it.
19483,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei That changes nothing.
19484,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
19485,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
19486,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
19487,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
19488,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion All right, what should the army do?"
19489,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,"grey We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
19490,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion And then?
19491,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
19492,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric Clegane.
19493,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros What the fuck you doing here?
19494,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Chasing them. You?
19495,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros Hanging them.
19496,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Any particular reason?
19497,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
19498,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
19499,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros You've got friends?
19500,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Not anymore. They're mine.
19501,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric It's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.
19502,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
19503,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
19504,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
19505,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric You can have one of them.
19506,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Two.
19507,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros No, no, no."
19508,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros We're not butchers. We hang them.
19509,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?
19510,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros They die.
19511,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor We all bloody die.
19512,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Except this one here. I'll only gut one of them.
19513,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric No.
19514,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor I'll chop off one hand.
19515,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
19516,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Bunch of nancies.
19517,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
19518,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros You're getting old, Clegane."
19519,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor He's not.
19520,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lem,lem Please don't. I'll give you anything.
19521,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Got anything to eat?
19522,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros Enjoying yourself?
19523,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor I prefer chicken.
19524,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric You ought to join us. We could use you.
19525,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
19526,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
19527,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
19528,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric Cold winds are rising in the North.
19529,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor And you're going to go stop them?
19530,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric We need good men to help us.
19531,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
19532,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
19533,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
19534,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,"beric Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
19535,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya Lady Crane?
19536,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,"waif If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
19537,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif Instead…
19538,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.
19539,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
19540,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
19541,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya You told her to kill me.
19542,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen,jaqen Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
19543,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen,jaqen Finally a girl is no one.
19544,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
19545,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
19546,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion Perhaps we should take shelter.
19547,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys The city is on the rise?
19548,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
19549,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
19550,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion it proves that no one needs a Master.
19551,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Good. Shall we begin?
19552,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion Do we have a plan?
19553,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
19554,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys You don't approve?
19555,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
19556,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
19557,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys This is entirely different.
19558,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
19559,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"razdal Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
19560,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
19561,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,yezzan The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
19562,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
19563,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,razdal I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
19564,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys My reign has just begun.
19565,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Dracarys.
19566,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey,grey You men have a choice
19567,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey,"grey fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
19568,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
19569,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,missandei,missandei Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
19570,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
19571,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,razdal Him. He should die.
19572,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,belicho,"belicho Yes, him."
19573,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"razdal He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
19574,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,yezzan Please.
19575,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
19576,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon You don't have to be here.

19578,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,ramsay My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.
19579,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
19580,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
19581,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
19582,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
19583,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
19584,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa How do we know you have him?
19585,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay Now, if you want to save —"
19586,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
19587,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
19588,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
19589,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
19590,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
19591,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
19592,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
19593,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
19594,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund stares blankly at JON SNOW.
19595,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon A pincer move.
19596,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
19597,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund Good.
19598,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
19599,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
19600,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
19601,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos We should all get some sleep.
19602,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
19603,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
19604,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Aye, for what they're worth."
19605,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
19606,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon You're right.
19607,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
19608,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon He's overconfident.
19609,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
19610,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
19611,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa You don't know him.
19612,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
19613,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
19614,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon We can't give up on our brother.
19615,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
19616,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon Of course he does. What should I do differently?
19617,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
19618,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Aye, that's good advice."
19619,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa You think that's obvious?
19620,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Well, it is a bit obvious."
19621,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
19622,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
19623,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa It's not enough!
19624,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
19625,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
19626,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
19627,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
19628,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos You think there's hope?
19629,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
19630,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
19631,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund You saw these demons?
19632,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos What?
19633,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
19634,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
19635,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
19636,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund Jon Snow's not a king.
19637,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos No, he's not."
19638,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
19639,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
19640,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund So what do you do all night?
19641,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
19642,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund Happy shitting.
19643,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon My lady. You weren't at the war council.
19644,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre I'm not a soldier.
19645,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon Any advice?
19646,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre Don't lose.
19647,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
19648,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre I'll have to try.
19649,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
19650,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"melisandre I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
19651,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
19652,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
19653,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon How do you know what he commands?
19654,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"melisandre I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
19655,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon Why?
19656,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
19657,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon What kind of god would do something like that?
19658,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre The one we've got.
19659,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
19660,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon It was a long time ago.
19661,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
19662,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
19663,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara And he paid for them.
19664,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
19665,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
19666,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon Not my claim. Hers.
19667,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys And what's wrong with you?
19668,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon I'm not fit to rule.
19669,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion We can agree upon that at least.
19670,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
19671,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara No more than Westeros.
19672,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
19673,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
19674,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara You and I have that in common.
19675,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
19676,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Will their ships be enough?
19677,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
19678,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
19679,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys So why shouldn't I wait for him?
19680,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
19681,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,"yara His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
19682,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
19683,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,"yara I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
19684,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
19685,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion The Seven Kingdoms.
19686,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon All of them.
19687,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
19688,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
19689,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys And that's all?
19690,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
19691,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys Reasonable.
19692,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
19693,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
19694,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
19695,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara That's our way of life.
19696,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys No more.
19697,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara No more.

19725,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,ramsay I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.

19741,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,loras There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
19742,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,sparrow To which crimes will you be confessing?
19743,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,loras All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
19744,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,"loras I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
19745,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"sparrow The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
19746,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,loras I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.

19748,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,loras I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.

19768,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"qyburn This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."

You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
19784,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei,cersei You've always been quiet.

19812,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime,jaime I'm sure he would be.
19813,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,walder Edmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.

19819,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,walder I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
19820,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime,"jaime Yes, you're a great conqueror."
19821,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"walder Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
19822,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime,"jaime They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"

19826,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei,"cersei He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."

19848,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
19849,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,davos You burned a little girl alive!
19850,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre I only do what my Lord commands!
19851,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"davos If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
19852,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
19853,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,davos I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
19854,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
19855,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"davos The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."

19925,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
19926,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,tyrion Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
19927,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.

Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
19931,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."

A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."

20048,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"

20052,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20053,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa So I can't question your decisions anymore?
20054,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon Of course you can, but--"
20055,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20056,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,jon Do you think I'm Joffrey?
20057,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.

20065,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."

20067,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20068,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20069,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20070,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa I'm not trying to undermine you.
20071,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20072,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,jon And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20073,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa Would that be so terrible?

20077,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,jon Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20078,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20079,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,"jon I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20080,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20081,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,jon There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20082,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20083,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon,jon You almost sound as if you admire her.
20084,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa I learned a great deal from her.
20085,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime What is this?
20086,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20087,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20088,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei It's ours now, we just have to take it."
20089,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20090,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime No, not angry."

20092,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime Should I be?
20093,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
20094,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime Dragonstone.
20095,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20096,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Enemies to the east.
20097,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
20098,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
20099,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20100,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20101,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20102,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
20103,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
20104,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
20105,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20106,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
20107,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei A dynasty for us, then."
20108,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime We never talked about Tommen.
20109,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei There's nothing to say.
20110,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime Our baby boy killed himself.
20111,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
20112,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime Cersei--
20113,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
20114,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
20115,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20116,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20117,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20118,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20119,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Not all of them.
20120,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime Well, it looks like all of them."
20121,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20122,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20123,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20124,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20125,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20126,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
20127,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei A queen.
20128,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20129,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20130,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20131,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20132,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20133,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20134,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20135,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20136,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20137,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei If not the most humble.
20138,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20139,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei What do you want in return?
20140,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20141,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei I decline your proposal.
20142,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron Why?
20143,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20144,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20145,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20146,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20147,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn Weigh that.
20148,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
20149,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20150,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn What's the weight?
20151,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam Um, 147."
20152,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20153,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn I don't remember your proposition.
20154,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20155,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20156,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam No.
20157,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20158,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20159,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20160,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam Sources in the restricted area?
20161,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20162,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam So, you believe me."
20163,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20164,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20165,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20166,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn Be a good lad. Clean this up.
20167,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne Nope.

20171,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20172,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20173,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20174,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa At the moment, peace and quiet."
20175,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."

20180,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa I know exactly what he wants.
20181,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20182,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.

20191,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20192,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20193,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."

20195,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya What are you doing in the Riverlands?

20200,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,"arya You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."

20209,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.

20215,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Bad night to be outdoors.
20216,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20217,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20218,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
20219,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Why are you always in such a foul mood?
20220,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Experience.
20221,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric This seems like a good place to spend the night.
20222,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor These people don't want us here.
20223,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20224,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor I don't like the look of it.
20225,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20226,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20227,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20228,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor They don't.
20229,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20230,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric How do you think it ended for them?
20231,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor With death.
20232,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
20233,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Doesn't matter now.
20234,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric No, doesn't matter now."
20235,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
20236,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
20237,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
20238,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
20239,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
20240,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor But there's nothing special about you.
20241,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric You're right about that.
20242,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
20243,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
20244,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor And?
20245,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
20246,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Your Lord.
20247,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
20248,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
20249,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Clegane.
20250,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
20251,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
20252,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
20253,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
20254,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor What do you want?
20255,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Look into the flames.
20256,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor I don't want to look in the damn flames.
20257,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
20258,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
20259,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
20260,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros What do you see?
20261,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Logs burning.
20262,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros Keep looking. What do you see?
20263,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
20264,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros What else?
20265,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
20266,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
20267,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Thousands of them.
20268,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
20269,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
20270,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Burying the dead.
20271,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros You knew these people.
20272,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor Not really.
20273,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
20274,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,little,little Mom.
20275,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,"gilly You should really sleep, Sam."
20276,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam The dead don't.
20277,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly Legends of the Long Night.
20278,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
20279,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly What is it?
20280,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
20281,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly That's dragonglass?
20282,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
20283,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah,jorah Has she come yet?
20284,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam Who?
20285,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah,jorah The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
20286,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam Haven't heard anything.
20287,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,daenerys,daenerys Shall we begin?
20288,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion On a night like this, you came into the world."
20289,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
20290,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys I wish I could remember it.
20291,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
20292,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
20293,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Good.
20294,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Not so many lions.
20295,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
20296,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
20297,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
20298,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
20299,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
20300,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys No.
20301,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
20302,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys I never properly thanked you for that.
20303,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
20304,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
20305,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys I did.
20306,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys And then you served the man who overthrew him?
20307,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
20308,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
20309,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
20310,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
20311,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
20312,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
20313,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
20314,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
20315,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys Which you turned to your advantage.
20316,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Who gave the order to kill me?
20317,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys King Robert.
20318,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Who hired the assassins?
20319,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
20320,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
20321,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys To keep yourself alive.
20322,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
20323,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
20324,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
20325,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
20326,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys I swear it, my queen."
20327,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
20328,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
20329,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,"grey Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
20330,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
20331,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
20332,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre I am called Melisandre.
20333,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
20334,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre No, it didn't."
20335,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
20336,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
20337,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
20338,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
20339,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys What does your Lord expect from me?
20340,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
20341,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
20342,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,"missandei Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
20343,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
20344,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys No, but I like it better."
20345,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
20346,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
20347,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
20348,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys You know him?
20349,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
20350,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
20351,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
20352,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys He sounds like quite a man.
20353,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
20354,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
20355,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
20356,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
20357,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
20358,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon Read the last bit.

20360,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
20361,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,"sansa Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""

But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."

In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."

20383,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
20384,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,jaime And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --

20386,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,jaime I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
20387,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
20388,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,"jaime You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
20389,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll I've known Olenna since I was a child.

20391,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,jaime When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.

20400,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
20401,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.

20409,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,"cersei No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
20410,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,qyburn Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
20411,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,cersei They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

20417,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
20418,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
20419,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
20420,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
20421,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
20422,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
20423,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
20424,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,olenna Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
20425,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
20426,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
20427,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."

20429,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion You are.
20430,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
20431,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
20432,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
20433,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
20434,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys Do I have your support?
20435,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara You have mine.

20438,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
20439,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
20440,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
20441,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey Enter.
20442,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?

20449,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei Why?
20450,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey You know why.
20451,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei I don't.
20452,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey You are my weakness.
20453,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei That's what I am? Your weakness?
20454,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,"grey When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
20455,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei I believe it.
20456,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
20457,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei I do too.

20459,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei I want to see you. Please.
20460,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.

20462,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn And this one.
20463,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
20464,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam I wanted to ask you --
20465,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
20466,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
20467,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam Possibly something a bit more poetic?
20468,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn We're not poets, Tarley."

20470,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn This is your moment. Use it wisely.
20471,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
20472,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.

20476,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.

20483,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
20484,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam If you could take off your shirt.
20485,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."

20487,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
20488,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
20489,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
20490,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
20491,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,"man If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
20492,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man As long as we get back there before they start.
20493,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man One more round. It's a long ride.
20494,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Ary!
20495,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,"arya Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
20496,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Mmm. This is good.
20497,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
20498,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya I didn't do that.
20499,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot You've been making pies?
20500,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya One or two.
20501,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
20502,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Big lady?
20503,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
20504,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya She found me.
20505,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot What happened to you Ary?
20506,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya You got any ale?
20507,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Where are you heading?
20508,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya King's Landing.
20509,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Why?
20510,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya I heard Cersei's queen now.
20511,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
20512,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Hmm.
20513,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot I can't believe someone could do that.
20514,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Cersei would do that.
20515,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
20516,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
20517,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot No. The Boltons are dead.
20518,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya What?
20519,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
20520,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya You're lying.
20521,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
20522,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Thanks for the pie.
20523,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
20524,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Thanks.
20525,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,"arya Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
20526,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,"hot No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor."
20527,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon Come in.
20528,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,wolkan,"wolkan A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
20529,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
20530,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
20531,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
20532,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
20533,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
20534,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
20535,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
20536,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon I know that.
20537,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,"sansa She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
20538,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
20539,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yohn,"yohn Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
20540,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,robett,"robett We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
20541,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lyanna,"lyanna Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north."
20542,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
20543,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
20544,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
20545,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
20546,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon I'm leaving both in good hands.
20547,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa Whose?
20548,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
20549,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,petyr I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
20550,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,"petyr I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
20551,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon You don't belong down here.
20552,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,petyr Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
20553,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon I have nothing to say to you.
20554,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,"petyr Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
20555,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
20556,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Nymeria?
20557,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,"arya Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
20558,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya Come with me.
20559,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya That's not you.
20560,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,nymeria You can't have them all. It's not fair.
20561,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,obara I'm oldest.
20562,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene Momma will want Cersei for herself.
20563,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,obara She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
20564,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,nymeria The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
20565,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
20566,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,"obara Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
20567,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
20568,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
20569,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara A few times. Never stayed long.
20570,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria A boy in every port?
20571,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,"yara A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
20572,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria Could we get some more?
20573,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara I thought it wasn't for you.
20574,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria I'm developing a taste for it.
20575,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara He's not your servant.
20576,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon,theon It's fine.
20577,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
20578,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara Once I kill my uncle.
20579,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria And what will you be, handsome?"
20580,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon,theon Whatever my queen demands.
20581,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,"yara He'll be my advisor, my protector."
20582,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria Oh, I see. Your protector."
20583,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria So if someone gets too close to you --
20584,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara He might have to intervene.
20585,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria hold that person back.
20586,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara Until they've made their intentions known.
20587,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
20588,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara Stay here.
20589,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara Euron.
20590,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
20591,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria Kill us! Get it over with!
20592,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron,euron Give your uncle a kiss.

20598,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
20599,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
20600,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
20601,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I'm Tyrion Lannister.

20603,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion and DAVOS shake hands.
20604,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20605,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos Unluckily for me.
20606,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
20607,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
20608,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Of course.
20609,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"missandei Please, this way."
20610,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
20611,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei I was born on the Island of Naarth.
20612,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
20613,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos This place has changed.
20614,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."

20616,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Does she miss me terribly?
20617,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion A sham marriage and unconsummated.
20618,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I didn't ask --
20619,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
20620,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon She's starting to let on.
20621,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
20622,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
20623,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
20624,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
20625,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
20626,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon True. But I'm not a Stark.
20627,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
20628,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
20629,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
20630,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
20631,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
20632,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
20633,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
20634,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
20635,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys Why?

20637,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys So where will you go?
20638,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre Volantis.
20639,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
20640,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre I will return, dear spider. One last time."
20641,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys My Lady --
20642,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
20643,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"missandei You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
20644,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos This is Jon Snow.
20645,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos He's King in the North.
20646,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
20647,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon The winds were kind, Your Grace."

20649,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Forgive me --
20650,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
20651,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
20652,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos I wasn't there, Your Grace."
20653,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
20654,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Forever.
20655,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
20656,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I am not.
20657,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
20658,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
20659,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
20660,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
20661,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Then why are you here?
20662,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Because I need your help and you need mine.
20663,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
20664,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I did.
20665,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
20666,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon They're hard to miss.
20667,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys But still, I need your help?"
20668,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
20669,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Almost.
20670,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
20671,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
20672,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
20673,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys You told me you liked this man.
20674,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I do.
20675,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
20676,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
20677,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
20678,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
20679,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
20680,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys The dead?
20681,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Is that another figure of speech?
20682,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon The Army of the Dead is on the march.
20683,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion The Army of the Dead?
20684,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
20685,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion No, I don't think you're either of those things."
20686,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
20687,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon we're finished.
20688,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
20689,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
20690,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
20691,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
20692,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
20693,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion whatever you saw beyond the wall.
20694,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
20695,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
20696,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
20697,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
20698,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
20699,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
20700,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
20701,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
20702,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon And why would I do that?
20703,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
20704,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
20705,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
20706,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Am I your prisoner?
20707,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Not yet.

20709,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys And?
20710,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
20711,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys All of them?

20715,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon,theon I couldn't save her. I tried.
20716,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain You wouldn't be here if you tried.
20717,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
20718,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
20719,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron Oh no!
20720,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron What a twat.
20721,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
20722,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron I give you --
20723,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
20724,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
20725,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron A bit more than a true friend.
20726,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
20727,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron There's only one reward I want.
20728,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei You shall have what your heart desires --
20729,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei when the war is won.

20731,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
20732,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
20733,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
20734,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime Advice?
20735,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
20736,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
20737,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
20738,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
20739,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei It doesn't matter now.
20740,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
20741,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei I imagine she is your favorite.
20742,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
20743,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
20744,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
20745,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
20746,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
20747,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."

20751,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei That's the one.

20753,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"qyburn Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
20754,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei But death is certain?

20757,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.

20759,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime Don't.

20768,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
20769,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
20770,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
20771,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
20772,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
20773,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
20774,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
20775,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
20776,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
20777,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20778,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20779,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
20780,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
20781,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
20782,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
20783,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
20784,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
20785,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho Your father's daughter indeed.
20786,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
20787,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
20788,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I'm a prisoner on this island.
20789,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
20790,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Except to my ship. They took my ship.
20791,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I wouldn't say we took your ship.
20792,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
20793,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
20794,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
20795,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon You probably don't believe me.
20796,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I do actually.
20797,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
20798,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
20799,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
20800,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Good question.
20801,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
20802,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
20803,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
20804,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
20805,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
20806,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
20807,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
20808,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon What do you mean?
20809,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
20810,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Dragonglass?
20811,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
20812,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
20813,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
20814,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
20815,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
20816,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
20817,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
20818,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Which wise man said this?
20819,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion I don't remember.
20820,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
20821,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
20822,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
20823,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
20824,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Amazing thing to see.
20825,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
20826,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys You lost two brothers as well?
20827,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
20828,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon You've been talking to Tyrion?
20829,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys He is my Hand.
20830,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon He enjoys talking.
20831,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys We all enjoy what we're good at.
20832,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I don't.
20833,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
20834,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I never expected that you would.
20835,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
20836,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon I haven't either.
20837,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
20838,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon Thank you.
20839,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
20840,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys You better get to work, Jon Snow."
20841,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa How much do we have?
20842,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan 4,000 bushels, My Lady."
20843,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa What does that mean?
20844,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
20845,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
20846,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,wolkan I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
20847,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
20848,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan No, My Lady, most likely not."
20849,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
20850,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn Very wise, My Lady."
20851,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
20852,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
20853,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn No, My Lady."
20854,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
20855,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
20856,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
20857,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
20858,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa So they should be.
20859,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
20860,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
20861,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr I only meant to say --
20862,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
20863,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,"petyr One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
20864,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,"petyr Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
20865,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,guard,"guard Lady Sansa, at the gate."
20866,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,"bran Hello, Sansa."
20867,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa I wish Jon was here.
20868,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran Yes. I need to speak to him.
20869,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
20870,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
20871,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa I don't know what that means.
20872,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran It's difficult to explain.
20873,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa Try, please, for me."
20874,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,"bran It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
20875,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa How do you know all of this?
20876,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran The three-eyed raven taught me.
20877,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
20878,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran I told you it's difficult to explain.
20879,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa Bran --
20880,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
20881,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa I have to go back inside, Bran."
20882,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran I'll stay a bit longer.
20883,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Hmm.
20884,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Hmm. Does it hurt?
20885,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah A bit. Less than before.
20886,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn The infection no longer appears to be active.
20887,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
20888,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
20889,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah And the climate.
20890,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
20891,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
20892,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah How bad is it?
20893,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam I suppose I'll find out this evening.
20894,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam Where will you go?
20895,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
20896,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah I owe my life to her and you.
20897,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
20898,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah Perhaps our paths will cross again?
20899,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam I hope they do.
20900,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn You treated him?
20901,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam Yes.
20902,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Who told you to treat him?
20903,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam No one.
20904,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
20905,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam I seem to remember you.
20906,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn But you treated him anyway?
20907,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam I did.
20908,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
20909,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam I read the books and followed the instructions.
20910,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
20911,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,"sam Thank you, Archmaester."
20912,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn Come here.
20913,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
20914,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
20915,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
20916,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
20917,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
20918,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
20919,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
20920,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
20921,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion It's too great a risk. You're too important.
20922,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys What about Casterly Rock?
20923,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys The Unsullied will be there soon.
20924,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei And what will they face?
20925,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
20926,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
20927,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion No one has ever taken the rock.
20928,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
20929,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion They will be ready.
20930,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,man,man Draw! Loose!
20931,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
20932,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
20933,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
20934,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
20935,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
20936,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
20937,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
20938,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
20939,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,unsullied,unsullied There are none left.
20940,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey,grey There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
20941,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey,grey Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
20942,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna It's done?
20943,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime It is.
20944,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
20945,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime I suppose as well as can be expected.
20946,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
20947,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
20948,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna So you'll just let them take it?
20949,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
20950,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
20951,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
20952,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna Yes. You must be very wise by now.
20953,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime My father always said I was a slow learner.
20954,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
20955,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
20956,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime Widow's Wail.
20957,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
20958,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
20959,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
20960,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
20961,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
20962,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime Yes, it has."
20963,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
20964,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime I think we're done here.
20965,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna How will it happen?
20966,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
20967,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna Will there be pain?
20968,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime No. I made sure of that.
20969,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna That's good.
20970,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
20971,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,end,end CREDITS
20972,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime Halt that wagon!
20973,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
20974,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
20975,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
20976,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn There is no more High Septon.
20977,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime No, there isn't, is there?"
20978,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn There is still the question of my prize.
20979,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
20980,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime That's a lot of money I just gave you.
20981,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn It's not a castle.
20982,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn turns and points to Highgarden.
20983,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn How about that one? It's available.
20984,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime You don't want Highgarden.
20985,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn I beg to differ.
20986,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
20987,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
20988,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
20989,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
20990,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn Right. Just not to me.
20991,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
20992,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
20993,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime Stranger things have happened.
20994,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn Like what?
20995,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
20996,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"randyll The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
20997,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime The current harvest?
20998,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
20999,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime looks over to BRONN.
21000,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21001,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21002,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21003,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll My Lord.
21004,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon My Lord.
21005,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
21006,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
21007,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21008,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,"cersei You're too kind, My Lord."
21009,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
21010,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21011,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21012,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21013,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21014,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21015,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21016,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,"cersei It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21017,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21018,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21019,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21020,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
21021,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr This is for you.
21022,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
21023,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21024,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,"bran reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
21025,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21026,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran Do you know who this belonged to?
21027,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21028,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
21029,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21030,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran Chaos is a ladder.
21031,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.
21032,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
21033,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr stands up to leave.
21034,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran I'm not Lord Stark.
21035,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
21036,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
21037,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera What's that?
21038,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.

21210,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
21211,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys Enough with the clever plans.

21223,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21224,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon glances back towards the dragons.
21225,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,"jon But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."

21253,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne I'll try not to.

21265,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,"jon There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
21266,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,davos Fewer.

21274,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"missandei Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"

21279,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21280,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,davos The sounds liberating.
21281,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon Why did you leave your homeland?
21282,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei I was stolen away by slavers.

21289,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21290,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon You believe that?
21291,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"missandei I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."

21356,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
21357,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime Come on!
21358,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn Where are you?
21359,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
21360,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,guard,guard Your people can't fight.
21361,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
21362,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime Take cover!
21363,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,drogon spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
21364,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn Come on you fucker.
21365,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
21366,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,"tyrion Flee, you idiot!"
21367,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
21368,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime Come on, boy. Come on!"
21369,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
21370,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion You fucking idiot.
21371,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
21372,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,end,end CREDITS
21373,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime You could have killed me.
21374,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn What the fuck were you doing back there?
21375,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Ending the war by killing her.
21376,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn You saw the dragon between you and her?
21377,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn looks incredulously at JAIME.
21378,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn And?
21379,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
21380,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
21381,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
21382,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn You're fucked.
21383,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Don't you mean we're fucked?
21384,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
21385,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime I have to tell Cersei.
21386,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn pauses and looks at JAIME.
21387,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn Best well jump back in that river.
21388,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
21389,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
21390,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
21391,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
21392,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys Step forward, My Lord."
21393,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
21394,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys You will not kneel?
21395,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll I already have a queen.
21396,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
21397,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,"randyll There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
21398,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
21399,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion turns to speak to DAENERYS.
21400,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
21401,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
21402,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
21403,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon You will have to kill me too.
21404,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
21405,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll Step back and shut your mouth.
21406,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys Who are you?
21407,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll A stupid boy.
21408,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,"dickon I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
21409,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
21410,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
21411,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon I will not.
21412,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
21413,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
21414,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
21415,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
21416,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys I'm not beheading anyone.
21417,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
21418,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Your Grace --
21419,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
21420,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
21421,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
21422,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys Dracarys.
21423,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,drogon,drogon draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
21424,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
21425,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn My Lord.
21426,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
21427,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei How many men did we lose?
21428,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime We haven't done a full counting.
21429,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
21430,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime shakes his head.
21431,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
21432,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
21433,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
21434,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei turns and walks away from JAIME.
21435,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
21436,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime He didn't.
21437,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
21438,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
21439,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
21440,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei After all this time it still amazes me --
21441,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
21442,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
21443,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime After.
21444,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei And you believed her?
21445,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
21446,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei looks away, then sits down."
21447,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
21448,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
21449,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
21450,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
21451,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys They're beautiful, aren't they?"
21452,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
21453,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
21454,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
21455,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon You weren't gone long.
21456,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys turns back to JON.
21457,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys No.
21458,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon And?
21459,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
21460,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon pauses and doesn't say anything.
21461,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys You're not sure how you feel about that?
21462,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon No, I'm not."
21463,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
21464,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
21465,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon Thousands.
21466,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
21467,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon Ser Davos gets carried away.
21468,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys So it was a figure of speech?
21469,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
21470,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"guard This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
21471,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys He is my friend.
21472,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah kneels before DAENERYS.
21473,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah Your Grace.
21474,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah stands.
21475,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
21476,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I served with your father. He was a great man.
21477,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah nods to JON.
21478,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys You look strong. You found a cure?
21479,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,"jorah I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
21480,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys It would be my honor.
21481,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys steps forward and hugs JORAH.
21482,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran,bran s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
21483,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran,bran Ravens. We need to send ravens.
21484,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,wolkan nods his head to BRAN.
21485,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,archmaester,archmaester MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
21486,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
21487,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
21488,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
21489,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
21490,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam stops working and turns around.
21491,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
21492,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam Brandon Stark --
21493,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam the crippled boy.
21494,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn Do you know him?
21495,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
21496,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn And?
21497,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
21498,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
21499,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
21500,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam steps forward and clears his throat.
21501,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
21502,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
21503,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
21504,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
21505,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
21506,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam Archmaester --
21507,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,"marwyn That will be all, Tarley."
21508,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
21509,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
21510,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
21511,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
21512,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn I'm afraid so.
21513,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester Horrible business.
21514,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
21515,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
21516,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
21517,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
21518,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
21519,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys Not burn him alive alongside his son.
21520,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
21521,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
21522,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
21523,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
21524,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
21525,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Daenerys is not her father.
21526,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
21527,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
21528,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Who is that for?
21529,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys Jon Snow.
21530,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Did you read it?
21531,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
21532,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
21533,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion What's it say?
21534,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys Nothing good.
21535,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
21536,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
21537,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
21538,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
21539,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
21540,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon interrupts VARYS.
21541,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I need to go home.
21542,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys You said you don't have enough men.
21543,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
21544,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
21545,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
21546,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
21547,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion begins walking around the table closer to JON.
21548,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion So bring the dead to her.
21549,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
21550,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
21551,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Is that possible?
21552,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
21553,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
21554,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
21555,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
21556,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys And how would you get into King's Landing.
21557,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
21558,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion nods his head.
21559,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
21560,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
21561,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
21562,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
21563,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys turns to look at JORAH.
21564,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
21565,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
21566,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos They won't follow Ser Jorah.
21567,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon They won't have to.
21568,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
21569,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
21570,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys I haven't given you permission to leave.
21571,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
21572,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
21573,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,robett,"robett The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
21574,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,yohn,"yohn The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
21575,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
21576,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
21577,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
21578,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
21579,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
21580,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya These are mother and father's chambers.
21581,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa And?
21582,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya Nothing.
21583,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa Don't do that.
21584,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa turns around to face ARYA.
21585,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya What?
21586,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa Say what you mean.
21587,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
21588,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
21589,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa Are you angry with me?
21590,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
21591,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
21592,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya Their opinions are important to you?
21593,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
21594,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya Not if they lose their heads first.
21595,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
21596,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,"arya And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
21597,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa How can you even think such a horrible thing?
21598,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,"arya You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
21599,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
21600,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa I have work to do.
21601,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa turns and walks away from ARYA.
21602,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya My lady.
21603,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya exits the room.
21604,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
21605,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
21606,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
21607,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
21608,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
21609,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
21610,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion You're not staying here?
21611,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
21612,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion What if someone takes the boat?
21613,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
21614,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
21615,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
21616,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
21617,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
21618,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn And here I am ready to train.
21619,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Why down here?
21620,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
21621,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
21622,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
21623,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
21624,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn I'll leave you to it.
21625,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
21626,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
21627,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime remains silent and stares at TYRION.
21628,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
21629,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Don't talk about our father.
21630,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Listen to me --
21631,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
21632,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
21633,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
21634,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime shakes his head and says nothing.
21635,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
21636,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime What do you want?
21637,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
21638,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
21639,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
21640,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I wasn't sure I'd find you.
21641,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I thought you might still be rowing.
21642,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
21643,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
21644,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
21645,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
21646,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
21647,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Anybody give you any trouble?
21648,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
21649,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
21650,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry nods.
21651,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
21652,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I think you need to understand --
21653,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry I'm ready. Let's go.
21654,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos You should know what you're heading into.
21655,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
21656,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
21657,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
21658,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos You might want to bring one of those swords.
21659,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
21660,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
21661,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
21662,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry this I know.
21663,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
21664,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
21665,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
21666,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
21667,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Who should I say I am?
21668,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
21669,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
21670,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard You there.
21671,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
21672,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Is that your boat?
21673,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos It is.
21674,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
21675,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard The docks are that way.
21676,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
21677,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Still five gold dragons?
21678,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Are you joking?
21679,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard You must be even older than you look. 15.
21680,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos 15?
21681,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Apiece.
21682,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
21683,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
21684,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos turns and begins walking back to his boat.
21685,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard What's in the boat?
21686,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos pauses and turns back to the guards.
21687,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Not more gold.
21688,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Wine?
21689,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Mmm.
21690,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard I like wine.
21691,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Or hams.
21692,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Come and have a look.
21693,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Fermented crab.
21694,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard What?
21695,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
21696,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
21697,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
21698,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"guard Oi, Dwarf!"
21699,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos quickly walks to cut the guards off.
21700,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
21701,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard That dwarf --
21702,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Where did you get that scar?
21703,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
21704,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
21705,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
21706,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Perhaps there's some arrangement?
21707,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
21708,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
21709,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
21710,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos This is Gendry.
21711,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion He'll do.
21712,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
21713,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei That won't be necessary.
21714,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
21715,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn Ser Jaime.
21716,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
21717,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Why was QYBURN here?
21718,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
21719,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime I met with Tyrion.
21720,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
21721,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei What did our brother have to say?
21722,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Daenerys wants to meet.
21723,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei To discuss a surrender?
21724,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime To discuss an armistice.
21725,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
21726,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
21727,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei smirks and looks away from JAIME.
21728,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei Are you going to punish him?
21729,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Tyrion?
21730,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei Bronn.
21731,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime looks confused.
21732,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
21733,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime You let it happen. Why?
21734,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
21735,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
21736,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime Who will you say is the father?
21737,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei You.
21738,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime People won't like that.
21739,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
21740,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei Do you remember what father used to say about people?
21741,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
21742,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
21743,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei Never betray me again.
21744,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
21745,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
21746,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry I understand.
21747,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
21748,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry You don't have to worry.
21749,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
21750,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Understood.
21751,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
21752,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
21753,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
21754,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon You survived King's Landing.
21755,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Yet again.
21756,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon Your Grace, this is --"
21757,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry steps forward in front of DAVOS.
21758,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son."
21759,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon looks to DAVOS.
21760,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos He was meant to keep that to himself.
21761,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
21762,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I saw your father once at Winterfell.
21763,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry I met yours in my shop.
21764,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon You're a lot leaner.
21765,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry You're a lot shorter.
21766,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
21767,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon I grew up on stories about them.
21768,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
21769,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
21770,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
21771,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon Do you know how to use one?
21772,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry shakes his head.
21773,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon Well, that's a problem."
21774,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry I prefer a hammer.
21775,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry looks to DAVOS.
21776,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos He can handle himself.
21777,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon nods.
21778,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon We could use the help.
21779,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
21780,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
21781,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
21782,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
21783,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
21784,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
21785,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
21786,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
21787,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
21788,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
21789,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys We should be better at saying farewell by now.
21790,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,"jorah Your Grace, I --"
21791,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
21792,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
21793,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys smiles.
21794,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys But I've grown used to him.
21795,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
21796,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
21797,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon Heave!
21798,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
21799,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
21800,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam No.

21803,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
21804,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam looks away and pauses.
21805,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam None anymore.
21806,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,"gilly That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?"
21807,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
21808,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
21809,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
21810,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
21811,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly Steps. That number was steps.

21842,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.

21861,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
21862,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah He was my father.
21863,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund He hunted us like animals.

21867,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.

21869,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --

21874,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry How can we be?

21881,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry Never seen snow before.
21882,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
21883,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon You've never been down south.
21884,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund I've been to Winterfell.
21885,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon That's the north.
21886,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
21887,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
21888,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
21889,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
21890,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund We have to make due with what we've got.
21891,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
21892,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund This one is maybe not so smart.
21893,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon Davos says he is a strong fighter.
21894,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Good. That's more important than being smart.
21895,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund looks at JON as they continue to walk.
21896,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
21897,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
21898,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
21899,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros Are you still mad at us, boy?"
21900,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry You sold me to a witch.
21901,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
21902,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
21903,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,"gendry I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
21904,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Sounds all right so far.
21905,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry and put leeches on me.
21906,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Was she naked too?
21907,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros She needed your blood.
21908,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry Yes. Thank you. I know that.
21909,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
21910,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor It could have been worse.
21911,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
21912,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"sandor But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
21913,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry I'm not whinging.
21914,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
21915,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor motions to BERIC.
21916,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
21917,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
21918,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros Good lad.
21919,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
21920,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
21921,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
21922,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
21923,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
21924,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah Your father wanted to execute me.
21925,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I heard.
21926,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
21927,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah and JON glance at each other.
21928,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I'm glad he didn't capture you.
21929,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah Me too.
21930,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
21931,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,"jon Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
21932,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
21933,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
21934,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
21935,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
21936,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah pauses, then nods at JON."
21937,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah He gave it to you.
21938,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I'm not his son.
21939,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
21940,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
21941,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
21942,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
21943,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
21944,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa I remember.
21945,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
21946,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya starts a slow clap.
21947,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
21948,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa turns to look at ARYA.
21949,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa What?

21954,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa They forced me to do it.
21955,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
21956,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
21957,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
21958,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa They told me it was the only way to save father.
21959,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
21960,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa You were there?
21961,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
21962,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
21963,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I wanted to.
21964,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa But you didn't. Just like me.
21965,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
21966,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
21967,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I was training.
21968,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
21969,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
21970,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa You never would have survived what I survived.
21971,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I guess we'll never know.
21972,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa What are you doing to do with that letter.
21973,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya I don't know yet.
21974,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
21975,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
21976,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa Arya --
21977,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
21978,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
21979,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
21980,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
21981,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
21982,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya turns and walks away.
21983,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund You're the one they call the dog.
21984,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Fuck off.
21985,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
21986,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
21987,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor looks up at TORMUND.
21988,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Gingers I hate.
21989,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
21990,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
21991,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Don't point your fucking finger at me.
21992,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
21993,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
21994,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor I didn't trip. I was pushed.
21995,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Ever since you've been mean.
21996,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Will you fuck off?
21997,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
21998,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor stops and turns to TORMUND.
21999,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
22000,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Dick?
22001,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Cock.
22002,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Ah. Dick. I like it.
22003,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor I bet you do.
22004,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"sandor turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
22005,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
22006,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor stops and glances at TORMUND.
22007,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor Brienne of Tarth.
22008,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund You know her?
22009,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22010,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22011,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22012,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund nods.
22013,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund You do know her.
22014,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor We've met.
22015,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor and TORMUND begin walking.
22016,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
22017,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22018,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund I'm good at killing people.
22019,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric You don't much look like him.
22020,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon Who's that?
22021,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
22022,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon You knew him?
22023,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
22024,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I serve the north.
22025,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22026,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
22027,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric He wants you alive.
22028,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon Why?
22029,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric I don't know.
22030,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,"jon That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22031,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22032,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon So what are you fighting for?
22033,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
22034,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon But we all die.
22035,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22036,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
22037,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
22038,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon Aye. Maybe that's enough.
22039,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
22040,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor That's what I saw in the fire.
22041,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor points towards the mountain.
22042,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor A mountain like an arrowhead.
22043,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros Are you sure?
22044,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor turns to THOROS and nods his head.
22045,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor We're getting close.
22046,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
22047,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys Do you know what I like about you?
22048,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion turns to look at DAENERYS.
22049,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion I honestly don't.
22050,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys You're not a hero.
22051,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
22052,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
22053,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22054,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,"daenerys I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22055,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,"tyrion It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22056,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22057,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,"tyrion Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22058,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn Oil?
22059,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier Pitch, my lord."
22060,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn How many barrels?
22061,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier 500, my lord."
22062,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn Get 500 more.
22063,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier Yes, my lord."
22064,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22065,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime The thrill will fade.
22066,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22067,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime Gold?
22068,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22069,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime Family.
22070,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn Not without a cock, you don't."
22071,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22072,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn Yet, your brother--"
22073,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22074,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22075,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"man Archers, stand tall!"
22076,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,man Cover that wall!
22077,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon How many people live here?
22078,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion A million, give or take."
22079,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22080,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22081,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Why isn't she with them?
22082,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22083,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei And the rest of them?
22084,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,qyburn They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22085,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Including our brother.
22086,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn Yes, Your Grace."
22087,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
22088,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,missandei,missandei Why did they build it?
22089,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah,"jorah Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22090,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22091,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos Maybe it still is.
22092,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."

22097,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick Hard to blame you.
22098,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion Cersei will anyway.
22099,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick I'm glad you're alive.

22104,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor Not yet. You came pretty close.
22105,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne I was only trying to protect her.
22106,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor You and me both.
22107,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne She's alive. Arya.
22108,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor Where?
22109,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne Winterfell.
22110,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor Who's protecting her if you're here?
22111,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22112,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor It won't be me.
22113,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.

22115,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."

22118,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"varys And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22119,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22120,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22121,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22122,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion It's good to see you again.
22123,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn Yeah, you, too."
22124,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22125,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22126,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22127,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion You might.
22128,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22129,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22130,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
22131,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Where is she?
22132,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion She'll be here soon.
22133,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Didn't travel with you?
22134,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion No.
22135,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei We've been here for some time.
22136,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys My apologies.
22137,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion We are all facing a unique
22138,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron Theon! I have your sister
22139,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22140,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22141,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22142,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22143,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22144,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron Why?
22145,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Sit down or leave.
22146,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22147,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22148,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion We all know that will never happen.
22149,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Then why are we here?
22150,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22151,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22152,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22153,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22154,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys Yes. That's all.
22155,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22156,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22157,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei The word of a would-be usurper.
22158,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22159,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon We can destroy them by burning them.
22160,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22161,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22162,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22163,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime How many?
22164,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys A hundred thousand, at least."
22165,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron Can they swim?
22166,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon No.
22167,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22168,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei What are you talking about?
22169,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22170,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22171,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22172,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei In return, the King"
22173,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys Just the King
22174,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22175,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22176,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22177,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne Ser Jaime.
22178,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22179,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22180,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22181,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,"brienne Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22182,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime Fuck loyalty?
22183,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22184,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime And tell her what?
22185,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos I wish you hadn't done that.
22186,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22187,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon I know!
22188,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
22189,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
22190,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22191,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22192,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22193,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
22194,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22195,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon I did this. I should go.
22196,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
22197,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion You spoke with her?
22198,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22199,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22200,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22201,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22202,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22203,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22204,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I didn't know about that.
22205,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22206,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion Cersei, I didn't know."
22207,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei the destruction of this family.
22208,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22209,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei You killed our father
22210,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22211,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
22212,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I have never been more sorry about anything.
22213,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei I will not hear it, not from you."
22214,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei I will not hear it!
22215,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22216,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
22217,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22218,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei I will not
22219,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22220,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22221,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22222,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22223,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22224,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22225,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion Mm, not like this."
22226,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22227,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion Yes.
22228,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei Why?
22229,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22230,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22231,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22232,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22233,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22234,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion You're pregnant.
22235,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon No one is less happy about this than I am.
22236,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22237,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22238,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22239,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys I can't have children.
22240,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon Who told you that?
22241,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys The witch who murdered my husband.
22242,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22243,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22244,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon So, what now?"
22245,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22246,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22247,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22248,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22249,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22250,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22251,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22252,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22253,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa What does that have to do with anything?

22417,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,sam It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?

But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
22473,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real.

22491,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
22492,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"

22521,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
22522,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
22523,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.

22537,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
22538,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."

22545,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron Wars sometimes last years.
22546,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."

22549,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
22550,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron They were lesser men.

22565,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah How does he sleep with no eyelids?
22566,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"

22568,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn You're kidding me.
22569,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
22570,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
22571,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
22572,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
22573,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn Which girl?
22574,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
22575,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
22576,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
22577,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
22578,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
22579,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn Yeah, well, good luck with that."
22580,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
22581,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
22582,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn That fucking family.
22583,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
22584,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei I wanted those elephants.
22585,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,"euron So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
22586,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei You're insulting my late husband?
22587,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron Are you offended?
22588,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
22589,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron And the Kingslayer?
22590,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
22591,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron Life is boring.
22592,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei You're not boring, I'll give you that."
22593,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron Do I please the queen?
22594,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
22595,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei But now I want to be alone.
22596,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
22597,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,"yara Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
22598,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara We can take our home back.
22599,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon Daenerys went north.
22600,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
22601,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon You're my queen. I go where you command.
22602,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
22603,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon What is dead may never die.
22604,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara But kill the bastards anyway.
22605,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,wolkan,"wolkan Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
22606,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys The Karstarks.
22607,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
22608,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,davos Can't argue with that.
22609,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
22610,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion And our queen is grateful.
22611,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
22612,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
22613,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
22614,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion They do make a handsome couple.
22615,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
22616,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion I'm not that old.
22617,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Not as old as him.
22618,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
22619,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"varys Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
22620,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion What is that?
22621,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys Nothing lasts.
22622,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Your sister doesn't like me.
22623,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,"jon She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
22624,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
22625,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys How many today?
22626,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dothraki,dothraki Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
22627,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon What's the matter?
22628,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys The dragons are barely eating.
22629,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon What's wrong with them?
22630,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys They don't like the North.
22631,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Go on.
22632,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon I don't know how to ride a dragon.
22633,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
22634,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon What if he doesn't want me to?
22635,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,"daenerys Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
22636,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon What do I hold onto?
22637,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Whatever you can.
22638,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon You've completely ruined horses for me.
22639,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys We could stay a thousand years-
22640,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys No one would find us.
22641,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon We'd be pretty old.
22642,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon It's cold up here for a southern girl.
22643,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys So keep your queen warm.
22644,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys Don't be afraid.

22648,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"sandor You're saying you're good, is that it?"
22649,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,gendry I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
22650,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,sandor You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
22651,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya Leave him be.
22652,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,sandor I heard you were here. You left me to die.
22653,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya First I robbed you.
22654,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"sandor You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
22655,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
22656,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,"gendry Yeah, thanks. So have you."
22657,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,"gendry I mean, you look good."

22659,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,"gendry It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
22660,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,"arya Stay close to that forge, then."
22661,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,"gendry Is that a command, Lady Stark?"

22667,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya Can you make it or not?

22669,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry,gendry It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.

22676,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon I told you we needed allies.
22677,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
22678,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,"jon I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
22679,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa And a Targaryen queen.
22680,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,"jon Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."

22737,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
22738,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam,"sam No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
22739,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon Daenerys is our queen.
22740,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam,sam She shouldn't be.
22741,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon That's treason.
22742,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam,sam It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
22743,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,"edd Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
22744,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,tormund I've always had blue eyes!
22745,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,beric,beric Did you find anyone?
22746,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,edd The Umber boy.

22748,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,tormund His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
22749,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,edd We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
22750,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,"tormund If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
22751,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,tormund We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
22752,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
22753,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
22754,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
22755,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Your sister pledged to send her army north.
22756,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime She did.
22757,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
22758,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
22759,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
22760,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys We""?"
22761,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
22762,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion Your Grace, I know my brother-"
22763,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Like you knew your sister?
22764,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
22765,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
22766,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
22767,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
22768,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran The things we do for love.
22769,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
22770,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Because this goes beyond loyalty.
22771,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime This is about survival.
22772,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne You don't know me well, Your Grace."
22773,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
22774,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
22775,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa You vouch for him?
22776,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne I do.
22777,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa You would fight beside him?
22778,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne I would.
22779,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
22780,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys What does the Warden of the North say about it?
22781,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon We need every man we can get.
22782,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Very well.
22783,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime Thank you, Your Grace."
22784,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
22785,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I was a fool.
22786,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Not for the first time.
22787,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
22788,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
22789,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry Don't you have something better to do?
22790,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya You make my weapon yet?
22791,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
22792,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
22793,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry It's strong enough.
22794,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
22795,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya Are you going to be down in the crypt?
22796,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry No, but-"
22797,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya But you're a fighter.
22798,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry I've done my share.
22799,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya You've fought them?
22800,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry I did. Some of them.
22801,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya How many?
22802,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry A few. That was enough.
22803,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya What are they like?
22804,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry Bad. Really bad.
22805,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,"arya Really bad""?"
22806,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,"arya Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
22807,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
22808,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya I know Death.
22809,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya He's got many faces.
22810,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya I look forward to seeing this one.
22811,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya My weapon?
22812,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry I'll get right on it.
22813,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime I'm sorry for what I did to you.
22814,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
22815,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime I'm not that person anymore.
22816,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,"bran You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
22817,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime You're not?
22818,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran No. I'm something else now.
22819,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime You're not angry at me.
22820,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran I'm not angry at anyone.
22821,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Why didn't you tell them?
22822,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
22823,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime What about afterwards?
22824,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran How do you know there is an afterwards?
22825,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion Well, here we are."
22826,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime Yes, here we are."
22827,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion Together again.
22828,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion And the masses rejoice.
22829,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime How do they feel about their new queen?
22830,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion She's your new queen too.
22831,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
22832,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime And she is? Different?
22833,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion She is.
22834,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime You're sure about her?
22835,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I am.
22836,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime She didn't seem sure about you.
22837,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
22838,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Hmm.
22839,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
22840,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion Was she lying about the baby too?
22841,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime No, that part is real."
22842,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
22843,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime What?
22844,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
22845,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
22846,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,both,both A girl's mouth around-
22847,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Your cock.
22848,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion My cock.
22849,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
22850,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
22851,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne Ser Jaime.
22852,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Lady Brienne.
22853,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime He's come a long way.
22854,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
22855,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
22856,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
22857,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime It is.
22858,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne The rise, it should give us some advantage."
22859,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
22860,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime Yes, I think you're right."
22861,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne What are you doing?
22862,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne I think you know.
22863,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime I truly don't.
22864,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
22865,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime You want me to insult you?
22866,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne No!
22867,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Good.
22868,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
22869,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne I better get back.
22870,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah Forgive me, khaleesi."
22871,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Have you done something to offend me?
22872,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah Many things.
22873,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Long ago and long forgiven.
22874,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
22875,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
22876,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah You made the right choice.
22877,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
22878,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
22879,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah But the mind behind all those words-
22880,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
22881,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
22882,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
22883,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
22884,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,royce,"royce The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
22885,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
22886,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
22887,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
22888,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
22889,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
22890,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
22891,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
22892,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
22893,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa You never should have either.
22894,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I thought he knew his sister.
22895,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa Families are complicated.

22897,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa A sad thing to have in common.
22898,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
22899,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
22900,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa He loves you, you know that."
22901,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys That bothers you.
22902,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
22903,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys All my life, I've known one goal"
22904,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
22905,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."

22907,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys Someone taller.
22908,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
22909,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys I take the Iron Throne.
22910,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"

22916,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys But why aren't you with her?
22917,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon,"theon I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
22918,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,"man Milord, we're not soldiers."
22919,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"davos You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
22920,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,man Thank you.

22934,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon How did you find each other?
22935,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,edd We met up at the Last Hearth.
22936,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,tormund The dead got there first.
22937,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon The Umbers?

22947,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon Our enemy doesn't tire.
22948,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.

22950,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime So, what can we do?"
22951,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
22952,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
22953,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,"bran Yes, he will."

22956,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,"bran An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
22957,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam,"sam That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
22958,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion How will he find you?
22959,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran His mark is on me.

22962,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
22963,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa You want us to use you as bait?
22964,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya We're not leaving you alone out there.

22966,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,davos We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
22967,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."

22971,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,davos The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
22972,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,"jon If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
22973,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya Dragonfire will stop him?
22974,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran I don't know. No one's ever tried.

22976,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,tormund But at least we die together.

22987,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey,"grey When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
22988,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,missandei Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.

23000,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam,sam Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
23001,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,edd Thenn.
23002,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam,"sam I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
23003,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,"edd Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
23004,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam,"sam Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
23005,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,edd Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.

23009,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I wish Father were here.
23010,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
23011,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime That would be something to see.
23012,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
23013,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Mm.
23014,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
23015,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
23016,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion I was speaking in relative terms.
23017,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Do you miss it?
23018,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion Of course I miss it.
23019,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
23020,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
23021,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion The perils of self-betterment.
23022,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime Oh! My lady.

23026,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne I don't think that's wise.
23027,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne The battle might start at any moment.
23028,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne Half cup.

23032,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne All right. Just a bit.

23242,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa,sansa The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.

Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.

23325,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry,gendry I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
23326,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys,"daenerys Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"

23328,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys,daenerys Does anyone?
23329,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys,daenerys I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
23330,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry,gendry I can't be. I'm a bastard.
23331,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys,"daenerys No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."

23342,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,woman,woman I have to go down and get another barrel.
23343,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,jaime,"jaime We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"

23348,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,"davos Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
23349,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion,tyrion I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
23350,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,davos And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

23354,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion,tyrion This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
23355,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran,bran It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
23356,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion,tyrion You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
23357,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran,bran I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
23358,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion,tyrion You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

23376,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
23377,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
23378,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon She shouldn't be alone.
23379,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,varys You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
23380,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon Aren't you worried for her?
23381,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
23382,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
23383,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,varys We both know what she's about to do.
23384,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
23385,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
23386,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon What do you want?
23387,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,varys All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
23388,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon I don't want it. I never have.
23389,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
23390,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon She is my queen.
23391,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Your Grace?
23392,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion There's something you need to know.
23393,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Someone has betrayed me.
23394,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Yes.
23395,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Jon Snow.
23396,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Varys.
23397,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys He knows the truth about Jon.
23398,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion He does.
23399,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
23400,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
23401,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys And Varys?
23402,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
23403,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
23404,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion It was a mistake.
23405,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
23406,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion She trusts me.
23407,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
23408,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
23409,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion But it doesn't matter now.
23410,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys No. It doesn't matter now.
23411,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion It was me.
23412,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
23413,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
23414,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys sentence you to die. Dracarys.
23415,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
23416,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
23417,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
23418,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,"jon I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
23419,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
23420,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon I love you. And you will always be my queen.
23421,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
23422,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys All right, then."
23423,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Let it be fear.
23424,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
23425,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
23426,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
23427,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
23428,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
23429,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
23430,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion I beg you, my queen-"
23431,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
23432,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
23433,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
23434,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
23435,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
23436,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
23437,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,guard Let them pass.
23438,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,guard Through the gate.
23439,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,guard Get going.
23440,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,davos The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
23441,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion She wants to attack now.
23442,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon Daybreak at the earliest.
23443,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier Careful with that.
23444,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier My lord.
23445,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
23446,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,"davos I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
23447,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier He's always better when he's got some food in him.
23448,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
23449,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
23450,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier Ay up. Where you going?
23451,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya,arya I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
23452,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor,"sandor Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
23453,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier I need to go talk to my captain.
23454,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor,"sandor Go ahead, talk to him."
23455,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier Where's he going?
23456,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion I drink to eat the skull keeper.
23457,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion I want to eat the skull keeper.
23458,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion I want to see the ...
23459,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,unsullied We speak the common tongue.
23460,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
23461,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,unsullied We have orders to guard the prisoner.
23462,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
23463,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,unsullied No.
23464,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
23465,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion How did they find you?
23466,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Did you consider taking it off?
23467,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
23468,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion And you're going back to her, to die with her."
23469,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime You've underestimated her before.
23470,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
23471,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime Difficult to do from here.
23472,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
23473,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
23474,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
23475,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
23476,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
23477,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
23478,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
23479,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion The city will fall tomorrow.
23480,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
23481,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
23482,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
23483,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Why?
23484,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
23485,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
23486,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
23487,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion Swear to me.
23488,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime You have my word.
23489,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
23490,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime I'll try.
23491,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
23492,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime Your queen will execute you for this.
23493,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
23494,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
23495,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime You would have.
23496,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

23679,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey They are breathing.
23680,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"davos Look around you, friend. We won."
23681,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,"grey I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
23682,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon And what are the queen's commands?
23683,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,"grey Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
23684,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"davos Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
23685,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,davos Jon. We should speak with the queen.
23686,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys Blood of my blood.
23687,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.

23689,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys Torgo Nudho.
23690,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
23691,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
23692,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
23693,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
23694,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys Will you break the wheel with me?
23695,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys You freed your brother. You committed treason.
23696,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.

23698,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon What are you doing here?
23699,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon Hey, what happened?"
23700,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya,arya I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
23701,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon She's everyone's queen now.
23702,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya,arya Try telling Sansa.
23703,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
23704,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya,arya Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
23705,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Did you bring any wine?
23706,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon No.
23707,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
23708,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion So is there life after death?
23709,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Not that I've seen.
23710,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
23711,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon You didn't.
23712,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
23713,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
23714,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
23715,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
23716,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
23717,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
23718,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."

23720,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Cersei left her no choice.
23721,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
23722,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
23723,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion And she burned down a city for it.
23724,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
23725,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Would you have done it?
23726,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon What?
23727,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
23728,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon I don't know.
23729,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
23730,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon What's it matter what I'd do?
23731,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
23732,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
23733,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
23734,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Love is the death of duty.
23735,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion You just came up with that?
23736,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
23737,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
23738,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
23739,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon That's her decision. She is the queen.
23740,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon I'm sorry it came to this.
23741,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
23742,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
23743,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
23744,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon She doesn't get to choose.
23745,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
23746,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
23747,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
23748,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys It was necessary.
23749,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
23750,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
23751,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon And Tyrion?
23752,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
23753,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon Forgive him.
23754,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys I can't.
23755,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
23756,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon Please, Dany."
23757,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
23758,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
23759,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
23760,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
23761,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys Because I know what is good. And so do you.
23762,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon I don't.
23763,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys You do. You do. You've always known.
23764,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
23765,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys They don't get to choose.
23766,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
23767,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon You are my queen. Now, and always."
23768,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa Where's Jon?
23769,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey He is our prisoner.
23770,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
23771,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
23772,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,"sansa If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
23773,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
23774,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara,yara Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
23775,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa You swore to follow a tyrant.
23776,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara,"yara She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
23777,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya,arya Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
23778,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"davos Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
23779,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"davos If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
23780,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
23781,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion It's not for you to decide.
23782,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
23783,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
23784,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester,maester We don't have a king or queen.
23785,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
23786,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,"grey Make your choice, then."
23787,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,edmure My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-

23789,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester,"maester Well, we have to choose someone."
23790,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,sam Why just us?
23791,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"sam Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
23792,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,edmure Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
23793,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yohn,yohn I'll ask my horse.
23794,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,edmure I suppose you want the crown.
23795,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Me? The Imp?
23796,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
23797,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Can't think of a worse choice.
23798,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"davos Who, then?"
23799,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
23800,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
23801,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
23802,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
23803,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."

23805,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran,bran Why do you think I came all this way?

23892,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
23893,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn Indeed we can.
23894,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
23895,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,davos We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
23896,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."

23900,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,sam The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
23901,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn The strong live and the weak don't.

23904,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,sam Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
23905,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
23906,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,brienne I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
23907,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
23908,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
