When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

223,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon,jon: I don't care about that.
224,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"benjen: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."

332,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah,"jorah: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
333,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys,viserys: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
334,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah,"jorah: As you wish, your Grace."
335,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys,"viserys: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
336,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah,jorah: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
337,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys,"viserys: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
338,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."

341,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
342,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
343,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: One word and I'll hit you again.
344,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey: I'm telling mother!
345,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
346,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey: You can't...
347,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: Do you understand?

349,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
350,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."

356,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: The Maester says the boy may live.
357,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,"cersei: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
358,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
359,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
360,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
361,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,jaime: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
362,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
363,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
364,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,"jaime: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
365,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
366,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,"jaime: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."

369,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,"catelyn: I would have dressed, your Grace."
370,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,"cersei: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
371,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I never knew.
372,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,"cersei: It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
373,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I am grateful..
374,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei: Perhaps this time she'll listen.
375,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,jaime: A sword for the wall?
376,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: I already have one.
377,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,jaime: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
378,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Of course I have.
379,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,"jaime: At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
380,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
381,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,"jaime: Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
382,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Soon enough.
383,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime,"jaime: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
384,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,"arya: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
385,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: It's good you've got help.
386,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,"arya: Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
387,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Impressive.
388,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,"arya: Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
389,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
390,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: A present?
391,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
392,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: It's so skinny.
393,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
394,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: I can be quick.
395,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
396,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: I think so.
397,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: First lesson
398,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: I know which end to use.
399,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
400,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
401,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: I came to say goodbye to Bran.
402,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: You've said it.
403,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
404,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I want you to leave.
405,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
406,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: I have no choice.
407,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,"catelyn: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
408,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: You can. You must.
409,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
410,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: You Starks are hard to kill.
411,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: My mother?
412,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: She was very kind.
413,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
414,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: It was always my color.
415,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb: Farewell, Snow."
416,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: And you, Stark."
417,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
418,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
419,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
420,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
421,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: I've half a mind to go with you.
422,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
423,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
424,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
425,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: I recall a few chances.
426,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
427,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: Bessie. She was one of yours.
428,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
429,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: Wylla.
430,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
431,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: Nor will I.
432,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
433,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
434,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
435,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
436,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
437,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: She's little more than a child.
438,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,robert: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
439,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: Tell me we're not speaking of this.
440,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
441,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard: But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
442,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
443,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
444,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
445,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,"eddard: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
446,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."

448,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
449,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Why do you read so much?
450,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,tyrion: Look at me and tell me what you see.
451,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Is this a trick?
452,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
453,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: Until your brother killed that King.
454,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
455,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,"jon: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
456,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
457,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon,jon: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
458,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
459,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,"maester: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
460,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: Talk to Poole about it.
461,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,"maester: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."

463,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
464,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,"maester: Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
465,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: When was the last time you left this room?
466,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I have to take care of him.
467,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
468,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
469,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."

471,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
472,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,assassin,assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.

476,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Everywhere? Even in the east?
477,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.

479,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
480,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: The moon?
481,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
482,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
483,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
484,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
485,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: How old were you?
486,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
487,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Nine?!
488,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
489,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
490,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: Yes.
491,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Will it take three years?

494,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
495,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,maester: The boy was always sure-footed before.
496,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
497,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon,"theon: Saw what, my lady?"
498,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
499,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,"rodrick: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
500,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
501,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon,"theon: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
502,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester,"maester: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
503,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
504,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: I'll ride to King's Landing.
505,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
506,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,"robb: Mother, you can't."
507,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I must.
508,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,rodrick: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
509,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
510,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick,rodrick: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
511,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb,robb: What about Bran?
512,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn,catelyn: I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
513,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
514,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: Finish a man?
515,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
516,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,"daenerys: Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
517,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
518,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
519,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
520,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys,daenerys: No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
521,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa: Pardon me, Ser."
522,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor,"sandor: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
523,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa: I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
524,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor,sandor: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
525,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
526,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
527,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey: My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.

534,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: He's my friend.
535,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey: A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."

537,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey: I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."

539,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,"joffrey: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
540,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya,arya: Stop it!
541,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa: Arya, stay out of this."
542,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey,joffrey: I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
543,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa,"sansa: No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"

566,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei: How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert,"robert: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."

571,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei,cersei: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.

607,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
608,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard,eddard: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?

620,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."

No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
623,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
624,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"

631,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
632,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
633,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
634,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
635,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
636,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
637,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Grand Maester.
638,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,grand: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
639,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: And you served another King.
640,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
641,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Without the King?
642,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,"renly: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
643,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
644,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: We are the lords of small matters here.
645,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,renly: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
646,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: Mmm, how much?"
647,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
648,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,grand: Can the treasury bear such expense?
649,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
650,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
651,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
652,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: How could you let this happen?
653,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
654,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
655,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,"grand: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
656,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly,"renly: Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
657,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
658,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
659,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
660,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
661,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: Please, it's nearly healed."
662,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: It's ugly.
663,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
664,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey: I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
665,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
666,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: Do I have to marry her?
667,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
668,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: I don't want to.
669,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
670,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
671,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: How would you handle them?
672,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey: I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
673,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: A royal army?
674,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey: Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
675,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: And if the northerners rebel?
676,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,"joffrey: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
677,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
678,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: For me. I'm their King.
679,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
680,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: I'm not asking.
681,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,"cersei: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
682,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey,joffrey: So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
683,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
684,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,"septa: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
685,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I'm practicing.
686,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa: Practicing for what?
687,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: The Prince.
688,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,"septa: Arya, stop!"
689,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
690,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa: The Hound killed your friend.
691,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
692,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa: You're an idiot.
693,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,"arya: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
694,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa: Enough!
695,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: What's happening here?
696,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
697,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
698,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
699,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa,sansa: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
700,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa,septa: You've barely eaten a thing.
701,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: It's all right. Go on.
702,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: War was easier than daughters.
703,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: Go away!
704,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
705,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: Mine.
706,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
707,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
708,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Come here. Now what do you want with this?
709,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: It's called Needle.
710,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
711,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
712,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: laughs] That's the essence of it.
713,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
714,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
715,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,"arya: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
716,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
717,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: So was I! He is a liar.
718,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
719,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
720,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
721,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: Winter is coming.
722,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
723,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I don't hate her. Not really.
724,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
725,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I can keep it?
726,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
727,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old: Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
728,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran: I hate your stories.
729,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old: I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
730,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
731,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,"old: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
732,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb: What are you telling him now?
733,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old,old: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
734,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb: Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
735,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran: Maybe we do.
736,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,"robb: How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
737,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,"bran: I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
738,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb,robb: Don't ever say that.
739,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran,bran: I'd rather be dead.
740,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick,"rodrick: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
741,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
742,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick,rodrick: My Lady.
743,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
744,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: I would. We've done nothing wrong.
745,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
746,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
747,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard: Follow me, Lady Stark."
748,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
749,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
750,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
751,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
752,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
753,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
754,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: A dear friend told me.
755,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: Lady Stark.
756,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Lord Varys.
757,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
758,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: How did you know I was coming?
759,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys: Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
760,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Do you know whose dagger this is?
761,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: I must admit I do not.
762,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
763,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Yours?
764,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
765,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: To whom?
766,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
767,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,"alliser: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
768,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,alliser: Next!
769,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser,"alliser: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."

771,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: Good news or bad?
775,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor: Both.
776,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand,grand: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: My wife is in Winterfell.
779,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: Is she?
780,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.

784,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!"
785,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: It's an improvement.
786,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?"
789,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,rast: What do you care about our faces?
791,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: We have proof. We have the blade.
799,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,"petyr: I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr,petyr: Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: How could you be so stupid?
805,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: Calm down.
806,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: Then what are you raving about?
810,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: And my husband?
813,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
814,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: Let me go.
815,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: Never.
816,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
817,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: I wish I could see the girls.
818,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: It's too dangerous.
819,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Just for a moment.
820,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Until we know who our enemies are...
821,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
822,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
823,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei,cersei: And if you find the proof?
824,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,"eddard: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
825,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,"catelyn: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
826,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: He still loves you.
827,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn,catelyn: Does he?
828,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard,eddard: Off with you.
829,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
830,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan: Of course, your Grace."
831,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: Who was it?
832,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,barristan: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
833,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: How'd you do it?
834,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,barristan: Lance through the heart.
835,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,"robert: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
836,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel,"lancel: It's empty, your Grace."
837,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: What do you mean it's empty?
838,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel,lancel: There's no more wine.
839,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,"robert: Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
840,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
841,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
842,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,jaime: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
843,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan,"barristan: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
844,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: Your outlaw... Any last words?
845,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime: I cut his head off, so no."
846,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert,robert: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
847,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime,"jaime: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
848,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
849,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: From whom?
850,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah: If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
851,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: Tell them all to stop.
852,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
853,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: Until I command them otherwise.
854,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: You're learning to talk like a Queen.
855,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
856,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys,viserys: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
857,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
858,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: No!
859,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
860,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,"daenerys: Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
861,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys,viserys: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
862,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah: Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
863,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]
864,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen: I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
865,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: You're leaving?
866,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
867,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: What kind of reports?
868,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen: The kind I don't want to believe.
869,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: m ready. I won't let you down.
870,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
871,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: But I'm better than every...
872,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
873,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: A bear's balls.
874,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: You're joking?
875,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
876,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: And how do a bear's balls taste?
877,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
878,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
879,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
880,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
881,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
882,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
883,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
884,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
885,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,benjen: Call me what you like.
886,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
887,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
888,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
889,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
890,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
891,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen,"benjen: Enjoy the capital, brother."
892,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: I always do.
893,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
894,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
895,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
896,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
897,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
898,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
899,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
900,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Yes, Khaleesi."
901,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: What are you doing?
902,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
903,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah: For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
904,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
905,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: Armor.
906,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
907,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: Slow.
908,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Slow.
909,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,"jorah: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
910,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
911,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
912,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
913,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
914,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
915,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: There are no rabbits.
916,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
917,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"rakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
918,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
919,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
920,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
921,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
922,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: She does not want to eat horse.
923,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
924,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
925,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah,jorah: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
926,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
927,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,"maester: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
928,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: Eight... no, nine."
929,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester: All of them brief?
930,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
931,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
932,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,"jeor: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
933,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
934,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
935,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,maester: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
936,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor,jeor: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
937,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester,"maester: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
938,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: It's a boy.
939,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,khal,khal: How do you know?
940,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys,daenerys: I know.
941,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,"jon: I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
942,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
943,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
944,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
945,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,"jon: If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
946,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,tyrion: Of course.
947,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,jon: He'll never walk again.
948,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion,"tyrion: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
949,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon,"jon: Farewell, My Lord."
950,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
951,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: Who are you?
952,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
953,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
954,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: It's too heavy.
955,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,syrio: It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
956,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: What if I drop it?
957,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
958,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: I'm a girl.
959,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
960,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya,arya: A needle.
961,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
962,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio,"syrio: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
963,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",old,old: The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
964,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,theon: We have visitors.
965,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,bran: I don't want to see anyone.
966,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,"theon: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
967,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,bran: I don't want to go.
968,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,"theon: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
969,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
970,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb,robb: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
971,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
972,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb,"robb: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
973,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
974,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
975,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester,maester: He has no memory of that day.
976,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: Curious.
977,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb,robb: Why are you here?
978,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
979,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,"bran: Kneel, Hodor."
980,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: Do you like to ride, Bran?"
981,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,"bran: Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
982,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester,maester: The boy has lost the use of his legs.
983,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
984,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,bran: I'm not a cripple.
985,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
986,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran,bran: Will I really be able to ride?
987,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,tyrion: You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
988,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb,robb: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
989,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
990,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb,robb: You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
991,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."

995,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"

997,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
998,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,theon: My lady's whereabouts...
999,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1000,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,theon: Must have been a pretty sight.
1001,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1002,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,theon: We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1003,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1004,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon,"theon: Careful, Imp."
1005,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion,"tyrion: I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1006,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,"jon: Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1007,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,grenn: What in seven hells is that?

1059,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,doreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1060,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys,"viserys: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1061,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,doreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.

1067,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1068,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys,viserys: A pirate ship?

1211,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry,"gendry: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."

1232,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime,jaime: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1233,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory,jory: With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1234,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime,jaime: I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.

1259,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys: It's a gift. I had it made for you.

1267,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys,viserys: You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1268,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1269,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

1271,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1272,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: Sally on the side?

1274,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1275,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.

1278,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,"jon: I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1279,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: You didn't know where to put it?
1280,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: I know where to put it.
1281,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Was she... Old and ugly?
1282,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1283,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: What color hair?
1284,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: Red.
1285,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: I like red hair. And her... Her...
1286,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: You don't want to know.
1287,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: That good?
1288,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: Better.
1289,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1290,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: What's my name?
1291,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Jon Snow?

1293,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1294,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,"jon: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1295,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: So... You didn't know where to put it?
1296,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1297,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam,sam: It is a bit nippy.
1298,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1299,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon,jon: I build my own fires.
1300,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser,"alliser: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."

1305,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys,daenerys: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.

Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.

1497,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1498,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1499,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Important enough for the likes of you.
1500,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1501,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1502,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Jealous?
1503,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Why should I be jealous?
1504,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1505,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Might surprise you.
1506,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Hmm?
1507,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1508,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1509,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: You are jealous.
1510,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,"theon: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1511,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: And what about the Starks?
1512,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
1513,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
1514,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1515,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: You're a very serious boy.
1516,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: I'm not a boy.
1517,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1518,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon,theon: I don't want to pay for it.
1519,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Then get yourself a wife.
1520,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1521,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: How is your son, my Lord?"
1522,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: He'll never walk again.
1523,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: But his mind is sound?
1524,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: So they say.
1525,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1526,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1527,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1528,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: I didn't trust you.
1529,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: So why do you trust me now?
1530,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1531,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: What sort of doom does the King face?
1532,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1533,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Who gave it to him?
1534,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1535,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1536,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1537,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1538,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Someone who could afford it.
1539,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1540,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: He started asking questions.
1541,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1542,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,"illyrio: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1543,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1544,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,"illyrio: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1545,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: This Hand is not the other.
1546,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,illyrio: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1547,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1548,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio,illyrio: It never was.
1549,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1550,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: You do move quietly.
1551,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: We all have our qualities.
1552,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1553,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1554,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1555,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1556,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1557,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1558,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1559,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1560,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1561,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Strictly speaking.
1562,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1563,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1564,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1565,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1566,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: Saw me with your own eyes?
1567,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Eyes I own.
1568,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1569,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1570,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: One shudders at the thought.
1571,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Oh.
1572,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1573,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Have you?
1574,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1575,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Was that you under the bed?
1576,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1577,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Oh, please."
1578,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1579,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1580,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,petyr: To a small council meeting?
1581,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1582,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard: Off with you. No begging.
1583,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1584,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1585,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: I want to see my father.
1586,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1587,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1588,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1589,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1590,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: They said they were going to kill you.
1591,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Who did?
1592,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1593,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: Oh, Arya."
1594,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1595,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Where did you hear this?
1596,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1597,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: What were you doing in the dungeons?
1598,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: Chasing a cat.
1599,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1600,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: Your name, friend?"
1601,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1602,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: I'm a girl!
1603,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Did Benjen send you?
1604,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1605,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1606,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1607,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Know what?
1608,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Best said in private, my Lord."
1609,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Go on. We'll talk more later.
1610,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: Jory, take her safely to her room."
1611,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1612,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,arya: How many guards does my father have?
1613,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,jory: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1614,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya,"arya: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1615,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory,"jory: No fear on that count, little Lady."
1616,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Well?
1617,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1618,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis: You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1619,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn: To whom do I speak?
1620,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1621,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn: There was no time to send word.
1622,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1623,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1624,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,vardis: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1625,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn,catelyn: My sister will decide what he looks like.
1626,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis,"vardis: Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1627,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,tyrion: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1628,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1629,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion,tyrion: I like you.
1630,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1631,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: I need to see the King first -- alone.
1632,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1633,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Is it about my wife?
1634,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1635,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: The whore is pregnant.
1636,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: You're speaking of murdering a child.
1637,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1638,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1639,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1640,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1641,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Careful, Ned. Careful now."

1644,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Based on whose information?
1645,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1646,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1647,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1648,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"

1650,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1651,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1652,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1653,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,grand,"grand: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1654,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: We should have had them both killed years ago.
1655,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr,"petyr: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1656,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,"eddard: I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."

1662,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard,eddard: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.

He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."

1678,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa: It is.
1679,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin,robin: He's little.
1680,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!

1682,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa,lysa: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.

1695,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Only if I slip.
1696,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: And you prefer me like this?
1697,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Mhmm.
1698,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1699,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: I want you.
1700,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1701,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Hold still.
1702,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1703,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
1704,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1705,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
1706,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1707,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1708,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."

1711,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1712,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1713,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1714,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."

1716,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: Not as much as the Lannisters.
1717,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: But a lot more than you.
1718,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,"renly: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1719,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1720,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1721,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Do you know who should be King?
1722,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: Be serious.
1723,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1724,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: I'm fourth in line.
1725,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1726,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: Stannis?
1727,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1728,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: He's still my older brother.
1729,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: What are you doing?!
1730,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,loras: Look at it.
1731,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly,renly: You cut me!
1732,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1733,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras,"loras: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1734,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.

1736,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1737,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1738,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1739,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1740,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1741,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1742,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: Is my father wrong?
1743,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1744,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: We still outnumber them.
1745,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1746,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: Five.
1747,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1748,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: What do you want?
1749,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1750,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: Our marriage.
1751,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1752,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: Every day.
1753,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: How long can hate hold a thing together?
1754,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1755,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: Yes, it is."

1758,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1759,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: So why now?
1760,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1761,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,"robert: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1762,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei: I felt something for you once, you know?"
1763,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert,robert: I know.
1764,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,"cersei: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"

1766,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei,cersei: It doesn't make me feel anything.

I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"

1933,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion,tyrion: Confessing my crimes.

1940,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa,lysa: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
1941,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa,"lysa: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."

1969,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
1970,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,renly: Sounds exhilarating.
1971,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"

1973,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert: You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"

1977,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,robert: Those were the days!
1978,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,"renly: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1979,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert,"robert: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
1980,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly,renly: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
1981,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"man: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."

1985,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr: Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
1986,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,"eddard: These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
1987,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"man: None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
1988,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr: That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
1989,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard: You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1990,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand,grand: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
1991,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr: I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
1992,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand,"grand: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
1993,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,petyr: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
1994,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand,grand: Wel…
1995,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,"eddard: I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
1996,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard: You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
1997,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,beric,beric: As you command.

I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
1999,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand,grand: My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.

2003,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr,"petyr: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2004,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard,eddard: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2005,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin,robin: Is it over?

2598,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder,walder: l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?

2610,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor,"jeor: Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2611,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon: This is Valyrian steel.
2612,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor,"jeor: lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."

2616,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor,"jeor: Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2617,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon,jon: l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2618,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor,"jeor: No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."

2637,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam,"sam: He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."

2645,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn,catelyn: You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2646,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb,"robb: Fine, fine. And?"
2647,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn,catelyn: And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.

2649,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn,catelyn: And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.

2664,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester,"maester: We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."

2728,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,jorah: Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2729,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: l won't leave him.
2730,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,"jorah: He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2731,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,"daenerys: Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2732,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,"jorah: This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2733,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: The wound has festered.
2734,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"qotho: You did this, witch."
2735,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2736,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"qotho: No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2737,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,jorah: Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2738,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"qotho: Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2739,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2740,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"qotho: The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2741,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,"daenerys: l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."

2743,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: You've saved me once more.
2744,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: And now you must save him.
2745,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2746,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2747,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2748,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: Do it. Save him.
2749,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: There is a price.
2750,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,"daenerys: You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2751,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2752,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: My death?
2753,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,"mirri: No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."

2756,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,rakharo: This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2757,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2758,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,mirri: Go. Now.
2759,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: Take her and leave. Take her!
2760,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri,"mirri: You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."

2765,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: This must be.
2766,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,qotho: Witch.
2767,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,rakharo: Nothing good will come of this.
2768,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,"daenerys: No, you can't."

2772,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: The baby –
2773,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,jorah: Hmm?
2774,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys,daenerys: is coming.
2775,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,jorah: Fetch the midwives.
2776,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,rakharo: They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2777,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah,jorah: They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2778,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,rakharo: The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2779,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae: Are you in agony, my lion?"
2780,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: No.
2781,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2782,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2783,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Just used to it.
2784,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Drink.
2785,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Let's play a new game.
2786,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2787,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2788,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Not if you win.
2789,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2790,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: What are you good at?
2791,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: l happen to be a great judge of character.
2792,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: This sounds like a boring game.
2793,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2794,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: l don't want to play this game.
2795,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2796,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: But my mother hit harder.
2797,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: You killed your first man before you were 12.
2798,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2799,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: You've been north of the Wall.
2800,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: What brought you up there?
2801,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Work.
2802,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2803,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: l don't want to play.
2804,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2805,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Drink.
2806,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2807,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: And we've established the rules about lying?
2808,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Drink!
2809,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2810,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2811,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2812,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Are you sure –
2813,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae: Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2814,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2815,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: My turn.
2816,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2817,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Who were you in love with?
2818,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: That's not how the game works.
2819,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: l don't care the way the game works.
2820,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Our lord here used to be married.
2821,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Married?
2822,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: How did you hear that?
2823,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2824,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: Another night, perhaps."
2825,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Not another night. This night.
2826,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: lt's not a pleasant story.
2827,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae: Oh, maybe l will cry."
2828,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2829,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2830,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: For three chickens, l should hope so."
2831,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2832,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2833,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2834,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2835,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You should have known she was a whore.
2836,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2837,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2838,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: As l said, l was young and stupid."
2839,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You are still young and stupid.
2840,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: What is it? What do you want?
2841,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: You're sleeping through the war.
2842,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: What?
2843,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2844,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Get my squire!
2845,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: You don't have a squire.
2846,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: lf l die, weep for me."
2847,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You'll be dead. How will you know?
2848,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: l'll know.

2852,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: Stay low?
2853,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2854,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,"tyrion: l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"

2861,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2862,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion,tyrion: How did our tribesmen do?
2863,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: Yeah, good."

Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."

To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. .

3924,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: As soon as his God wills it.
3925,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"matthos: He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
3926,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: Oh you and your mother.
3927,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,matthos: It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
3928,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"davos: I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
3929,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,matthos: But you always came home.
3930,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: I wasn't praying.
3931,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"matthos: But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
3932,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"davos: You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
3933,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"matthos: Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
3934,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: Don't tell him that.
3935,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,cersei: Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
3936,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,tyrion: I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
3937,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,cersei: You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
3938,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,"tyrion: Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
3939,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,"cersei: Ha, the people. You think I care?"
3940,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,"tyrion: You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
3941,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,"tyrion: It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
3942,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,"cersei: He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
3943,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
3944,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,"cersei: I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
3945,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,"tyrion: As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
3946,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,"cersei: You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
3947,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion,tyrion: She was my mother too.
3948,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei,"cersei: Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."

3952,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
3953,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,"stannis: In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
3954,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,davos: Does seem the wiser choice.
3955,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
3956,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"davos: Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."

3961,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: What did you say to him?
3962,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: I told him death by fire is the purest death.
3963,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: Why?
3964,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
3965,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: Yeah.
3966,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
3967,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: Tell your lord to burn them then.
3968,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
3969,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
3970,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: You must have faith.
3971,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,"stannis: Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
3972,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: Then we must be the ten.
3973,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,"stannis: I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
3974,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"melisandre: I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."

3976,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: You must give... all of yourself.
3977,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis,stannis: I have a wife. I took a vow.
3978,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"melisandre: She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."

3994,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon,jon: Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
3995,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"jeor: Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."

4003,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,sam: Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
4017,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,luwin: All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

4070,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: Father.
4071,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"balon: The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
4072,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"balon: Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
4073,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,yara: I've always wanted a castle.
4074,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: And what's my role in all this?
4075,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,balon: You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
4076,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
4077,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,yara: The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
4078,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: I'm to fight fishermen?
4079,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,yara: Be careful of their nets.
4080,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,"theon: Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
4081,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,yara: They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
4082,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,"theon: What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
4083,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"balon: Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
4084,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,"theon: I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
4085,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,balon: What are our words? Our words?
4086,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: We do not sow.
4087,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,balon: We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4088,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,"theon: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
4089,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: You gave me away!
4090,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
4091,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,yara: You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
4092,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon,theon: I have no other family.
4093,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara,"yara: Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."

4095,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Keep your voice down.
4096,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
4097,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
4098,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: Again, only temporary."
4099,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
4100,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
4101,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Scullion? What is a scullion?
4102,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Kitchen wench.
4103,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: A kitchen wench?
4104,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, but-"
4105,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
4106,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
4107,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: I'm the weakness?
4108,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: It's a compliment, my lady."
4109,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: How is being a weakness a compliment?
4110,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Language can be a bit tricky here.
4111,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"shae: Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
4112,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,myrcella: When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
4113,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,"cersei: Soon, darling, when the war is over."
4114,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,"myrcella: Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
4115,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei: The princess just spoke to you.
4116,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,"sansa: Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."

4118,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei: He might.
4119,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei: Would you like that?
4120,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen,tommen: No. I don't think so.
4121,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,"cersei: Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
4122,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Come in.
4123,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Who are you?

4125,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
4126,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: No.
4127,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: What are you doing?
4128,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
4129,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
4130,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: What things?
4131,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,"sansa: Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
4132,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: No.
4133,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: You said to brush your-
4134,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Not now.
4135,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Your chamber pot is empty.
4136,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Clean the table.
4137,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
4138,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Yes.
4139,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: For whom?
4140,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Lady Zuriff.
4141,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Lady Zuriff
4142,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
4143,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: She wasn't in this city.
4144,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,"sansa: I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
4145,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,shae: Do you want me to leave?
4146,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa,sansa: Just brush my hair.
4147,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
4148,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4149,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
4150,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Please.
4151,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: Thank you, my lord."

4153,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4154,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4155,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4156,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4157,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4158,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4159,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,pycelle: Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
4160,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
4161,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
4162,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4163,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4164,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Precisely.
4165,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4166,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: But remember, you must tell no one."
4167,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr: Tell no one what?
4168,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4169,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr: She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4170,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4171,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr: And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4172,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Who better?
4173,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4174,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4175,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr: Harrenhal is cursed.
4176,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4177,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr: With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4178,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4179,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,"petyr: So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4180,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
4181,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: Good. Oh. And remember-
4182,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr,petyr: The Queen mustn't know.
4183,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: That must hurt.
4184,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: What? What is it?
4185,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras: A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
4186,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: Brienne is a very capable warrior.
4187,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
4188,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras: Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
4189,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: I'll make it up to you.
4190,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"loras: No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4191,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras: Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
4192,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: And Margaery's a virgin?
4193,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,loras: Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
4194,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"renly: I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."

4199,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery: You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
4200,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: You certainly don't need it.
4201,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"renly: Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
4202,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: Must be the wine.
4203,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery: Here, let me."

4206,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: What?
4207,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery: He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
4208,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,renly: I don't know what you're talking about.
4209,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,margaery: There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
4210,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery,"margaery: Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart.

4214,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei: I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

4216,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei,cersei: Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4217,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.

4225,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."

4250,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"pycelle: No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4251,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."

4273,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,varys: And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4274,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4275,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4276,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"

4280,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,varys: Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4281,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,"tyrion: He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4282,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4283,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion,tyrion: I've decided I don't like riddles.
4284,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."

I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"

4366,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,talisa: That should help his foot grow back.

4528,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
4529,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis: My own.
4530,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"

4532,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."

4534,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."

4538,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn,"catelyn: Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
4539,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,"stannis: It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."

4541,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,stannis: The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4542,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."

Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."

4558,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,"spice: Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."

4566,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,"spice: Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."

4580,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"xaro: Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
4581,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,spice: Our decision is final.
4582,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,xaro: Very well. I invoke soumai.

4601,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin,tywin: Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.

4609,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion: And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4610,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel: As I said several times.
4611,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion: And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4612,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"lancel: When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."

4618,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,"tyrion: An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4619,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel: You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4620,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion,tyrion: Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4621,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,lancel: It's not my fault!

4645,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4646,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis,"stannis: You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."

4669,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4670,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: And you will.
4671,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4672,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4673,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4674,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: They can't bar our passage.
4675,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Gods protect us.
4676,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."

4678,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4679,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4680,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: And the wording of this oath?
4681,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4682,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: And in return for my son's loyalty?
4683,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4684,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4685,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn: Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4686,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly: Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4687,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly: Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4688,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: No! No.
4689,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier: Follow me!
4690,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier: You'll die for this.

4692,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4693,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man: Inside the king's tent - go
4694,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man: Now.
4695,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: I won't leave him.
4696,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: You can't avenge him if you're dead.

4698,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: Not that way.
4699,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: We need to go home. Loras.
4700,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr: My lord, my lady."
4701,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: Get out.
4702,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr: Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4703,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: And you want that privilege for yourself.
4704,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr: You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4705,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: There's no time for this.
4706,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras: Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4707,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4708,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4709,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,petyr: Stannis.
4710,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4711,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: You can't stay here.
4712,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras: He would have been a true king, a good king."

4714,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: Revenge.
4715,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr: I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4716,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4717,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: He was very handsome.
4718,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,"petyr: He was, Your Grace."
4719,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,"margaery: Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4720,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr,petyr: Do you want to be a queen?
4721,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery,margaery: No. I want to be the queen.
4722,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: Killed? By whom?
4723,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4724,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: Really? Who'd have thought?
4725,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4726,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei: Whomever did it, I say well done."
4727,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4728,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4729,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
4730,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei: Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
4731,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: She'll be safer in Dorne.
4732,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei: Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
4733,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
4734,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
4735,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
4736,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
4737,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
4738,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,"cersei: You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
4739,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: It's important that we talk about this.
4740,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei,cersei: It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
4741,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: It's wildfire.
4742,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
4743,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: No.
4744,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: MThat's a lie right there.
4745,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
4746,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
4747,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: I'm telling you the truth.
4748,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: The smart money would be on more likely.
4749,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: She's making wildfire.
4750,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
4751,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
4752,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: I suppose there's only one way to find out.
4753,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
4754,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: When did she tell you this?
4755,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"lancel: I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
4756,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: Swear to me on what?
4757,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: On my life.
4758,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: But I don't care about your life.
4759,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"lancel: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
4760,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
4761,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
4762,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
4763,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: It will be my pleasure.
4764,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: Your Grace.
4765,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: What is it?
4766,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
4767,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis: Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
4768,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
4769,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
4770,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I-"
4771,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
4772,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
4773,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: You've come to lecture me on truth?
4774,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: I've come to tell you that what I saw.
4775,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis: All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
4776,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
4777,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: I'll hear no more about it.
4778,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man: Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
4779,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: When do we sail for King's Landing?
4780,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis: As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
4781,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
4782,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: That's not your concern.
4783,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
4784,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
4785,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: Loyal service means telling hard truths.
4786,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis: Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
4787,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
4788,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: What do you believe?
4789,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
4790,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,stannis: We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
4791,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
4792,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis,"stannis: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."

4794,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man: So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
4795,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man: Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
4796,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"

4798,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
4799,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
4800,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
4801,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,protester: Corruption.
4802,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,crowd,crowd: Yes!
4803,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,"protester: We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
4804,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: It's hard to argue with his assessment.
4805,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: Not after what he did to your birthday present.
4806,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
4807,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man: A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
4808,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: You have to admire his imagination.
4809,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: He's talking about you.
4810,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: What? Demon monkey?
4811,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.

4816,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
4817,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
4818,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black,"black: Where are we headed, Captain?"
4819,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon: The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
4820,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black,black: And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
4821,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: I do. Your captain.
4822,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black,"black: I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
4823,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon: You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
4824,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara,yara: Stop. We yield.
4825,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara,yara: Congratulations on your first command.
4826,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
4827,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara,"yara: Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
4828,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
4829,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara,"yara: That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
4830,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"dagmer: Come on, I'll take you out."
4831,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: Who are you?
4832,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"dagmer: Dagmer, your first mate."
4833,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
4834,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
4835,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
4836,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: You're not.
4837,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
4838,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
4839,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
4840,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"dagmer: The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
4841,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,"theon: No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
4842,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon,theon: Take me to my ship.
4843,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"reginald: The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
4844,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
4845,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,amory: Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
4846,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
4847,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"reginald: We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
4848,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
4849,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,reginald: My wife's in Lannisport.
4850,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
4851,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
4852,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
4853,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,"arya: Maidenpool, my lord."
4854,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
4855,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,"arya: House Mooton, my lord."
4856,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: And what is their sigil?
4857,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
4858,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,"tywin: Good. One more time, where are you from?"
4859,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,"arya: Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
4860,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
4861,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: They call him the Young Wolf.
4862,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: And?
4863,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
4864,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: And do you believe them?
4865,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,"arya: No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
4866,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin,tywin: Fetch that water.
4867,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: A girl says nothing.
4868,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,"jaqen: A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
4869,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: I was always a girl.
4870,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
4871,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
4872,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
4873,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: I didn't have a choice.
4874,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: You did. I did. And here we are.
4875,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
4876,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: Three what?
4877,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,"jaqen: The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
4878,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
4879,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: A man has said.
4880,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: The one who tortures everyone.
4881,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,jaqen: A man needs a name.
4882,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya,arya: I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
4883,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen,"jaqen: That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
4884,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"jeor: He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
4885,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: When will he come?
4886,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: The Halfhand does things in his own time.
4887,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: My uncle told me stories about him.
4888,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: Most of them are true.
4889,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
4890,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
4891,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
4892,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"jeor: Well, possible for the Halfhand."
4893,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
4894,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,dolorous: There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
4895,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man: About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
4896,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
4897,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"dolorous: Before I die, please, stop talking."
4898,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
4899,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,dolorous: Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
4900,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
4901,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,grenn: Wildlings?
4902,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
4903,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"dolorous: So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
4904,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
4905,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,"grenn: But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
4906,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,sam: Well I read it in a book.
4907,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,dolorous: I read it in a book.
4908,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
4909,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"dolorous: EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
4910,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"haylene: Take care, my lord."
4911,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
4912,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"haylene: Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
4913,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"haylene: After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
4914,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: My companion takes issue.
4915,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
4916,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,haylene: Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
4917,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: To do what?
4918,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,haylene: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
4919,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: How much do you have?
4920,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"bronn: If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
4921,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"haylene: My lord, this man is insulting."
4922,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"bronn: I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
4923,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,tyrion: My friend remains unconvinced.
4924,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,haylene: He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
4925,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"bronn: Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
4926,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"haylene: We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
4927,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: This is a shit idea.
4928,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."

4937,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,irri: It is known.
4938,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,doreah: And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
4939,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
4940,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,irri: May he ride forever through the night lands.
4941,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."

4945,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,woman: And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
4946,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: It sounds wonderful.
4947,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,woman: The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.

4949,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: What are they doing?
4950,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,"jorah: Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."

4952,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

4956,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
4957,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
4958,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,jorah: It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
4959,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
4960,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt,"pyatt: Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
4961,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt,pyatt: Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
4962,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt,"pyatt: Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
4963,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
4964,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: What is the House of the Undying?
4965,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
4966,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,quaithe: You watch over her.
4967,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,jorah: Do I know you?
4968,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,quaithe: I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
4969,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,jorah: Who are you?
4970,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,"quaithe: I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
4971,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: It looked like Stannis.
4972,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
4973,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: In the shape of Stannis.
4974,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
4975,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"brienne: Will you stay there long, my lady?"
4976,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn: Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."

4979,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
4980,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: It's a bloody business.
4981,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: What comes after is even harder.
4982,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"brienne: Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
4983,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: You mean to kill Stannis.
4984,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: I swore a vow.
4985,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
4986,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
4987,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,catelyn: Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
4988,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: I only held him that once as he was dying.
4989,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn: He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."

Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
4991,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn,"catelyn: When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
4992,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"brienne: Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."

I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."

5002,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,luwin: Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5003,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,rodrik: Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5004,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: We have to help them.
5005,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,"rodrik: Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."

5009,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,"bran: So, what does it mean?"
5010,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5011,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5012,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"osha: Must not mean anything, then."
5013,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: You're lying.
5014,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"osha: You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5015,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: You know what it means.
5016,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: I never said I didn't.
5017,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: You didn't give me an honest answer.
5018,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: That's not the same as being a liar.
5019,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,"bran: Well, it's not far off."
5020,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"osha: So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5021,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"osha: Something bad? Tell me, boy."
5022,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,"bran: I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5023,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: The sea is hundreds of miles away.
5024,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,bran: I know. It's just a stupid dream.
5025,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5026,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran,"bran: Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5027,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,osha: They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5028,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,qhorin: There.
5029,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: Where?
5030,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,qhorin: On that mountain.
5031,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,sam: I don't see very well.
5032,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: A fire.
5033,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5034,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: How many wildlings have joined him?
5035,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5036,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: Where?
5037,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,qhorin: Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5038,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5039,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5040,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: We need to get rid of those lookouts.
5041,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."

5043,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5044,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon,jon: I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5045,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,qhorin: He's the one?
5046,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5047,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"qhorin: Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5048,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."

5051,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5052,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5053,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: And what about what a woman wants?
5054,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5055,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5056,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: Why?
5057,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5058,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5059,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5060,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: Ah, a conqueror."
5061,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5062,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5063,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5064,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5065,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: I will show you why.
5066,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5067,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: And behind the door?
5068,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: And it can all be mine?
5069,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5070,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: All I have to do?
5071,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: Is marry me.
5072,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: That was a romantic proposal.
5073,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5074,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."

5076,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5077,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,"jorah: To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5078,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: The usurper is dead.
5079,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5080,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,jorah: According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5081,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5082,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,"jorah: Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5083,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,"daenerys: And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."

5088,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,jorah: To see you on the Iron Throne.
5089,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys,daenerys: Why?
5090,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah,"jorah: You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."

5156,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"rodrik: Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5157,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon,"theon: Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5158,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,rodrik: If he were alive to see this
5159,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon,theon: He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.

5193,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5194,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon: I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5195,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,qhorin: I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5196,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon: We could do the same.
5197,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5198,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon: My father always said I'm of the North.

5200,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5201,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5202,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon: I'll gladly give my life.
5203,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5204,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon,jon: I do.
5205,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."

5226,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr: So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5227,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin,tywin: Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5228,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr,petyr: It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.

He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"

5433,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb,robb: Because it's obvious.
5434,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"talisa: What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"

5459,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn,catelyn: You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
5460,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn,catelyn: A debt that must be paid.

5548,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon,"theon: With hunting, there's blood at the end."
5549,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: They're little boys.
5550,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon,"theon: I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
5551,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
5552,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon,theon: They have no value to me missing.
5553,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5554,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon,"theon: Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
5555,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,man: We have a scent!
5556,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon,"theon: The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
5557,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: We should have took more food.
5558,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran,bran: We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
5559,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
5560,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran,"bran: And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
5561,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: The boy can't survive on walnuts.

5563,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.

5571,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran,bran: They'll be after us with hounds.
5572,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"osha: We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."

5574,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
5575,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Let's move.
5576,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5577,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5578,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
5579,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Don't call them that.
5580,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: What, stones? Or bone?"
5581,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Neither. Both.
5582,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Move!
5583,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5584,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,"jon: There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5585,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: So the lads just do it with each other?
5586,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: No.
5587,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: Never?
5588,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Never. We swore an oath.
5589,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5590,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Would you please shut up?

5594,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,"jon: If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5595,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5596,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: It was my choice to say the words.
5597,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: So you don't like girls?
5598,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Of course I like girls.
5599,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: But you chose never to touch them.
5600,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5601,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5602,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,"jon: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5603,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5604,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,"jon: My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5605,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: So why are you fighting us?
5606,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"man: Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
5607,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5608,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountian,mountian: We hanged twenty men last night.
5609,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5610,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,mountain: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5611,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5612,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,"mountain: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5613,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
5614,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Mmm. Is that mutton?
5615,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,"arya: Yes, my lord."
5616,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Don't like mutton.
5617,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: I'll bring something else.
5618,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Leave it. Are you hungry?
5619,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: No.
5620,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Of course you are. Eat.
5621,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5622,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
5623,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5624,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5625,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5626,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Have you ever lost before?
5627,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5628,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5629,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5630,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5631,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Dragons?
5632,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Yes. Dragons happened.
5633,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5634,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Aegon and his sisters.
5635,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Mmm?
5636,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,"arya: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5637,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5638,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5639,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5640,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5641,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5642,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5643,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Most girls are idiots.
5644,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5645,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: From my father.
5646,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
5647,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,"arya: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
5648,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
5649,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: And, girl."
5650,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: M'lord.
5651,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,"tywin: Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
5652,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,"arya: My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
5653,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
5654,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya,arya: Yes.
5655,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin,tywin: Go on.

5659,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor,"sandor: No, it gives me joy to kill people."
5660,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor,sandor: Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
5661,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,sansa: It was his duty. He never liked it.
5662,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor,sandor: Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
5663,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,sansa: Why are you always so hateful?
5664,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor,sandor: You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
5665,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,xaro: I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
5666,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: You are one of the Thirteen.
5667,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"xaro: If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
5668,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
5669,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,xaro: Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
5670,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,"daenerys: There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
5671,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"xaro: I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
5672,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: But it did happen under your roof.

5675,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
5676,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,"jon: No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
5677,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
5678,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.

Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."

5739,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

5741,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,"daenerys: We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."

I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."

5749,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

5751,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys,daenerys: And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.

5762,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon,jon: Nothing happened between you and me.
5763,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"

5782,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,shae: You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
5783,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
5784,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,"sansa: My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
5785,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei: In what way?
5786,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,sansa: I thought it would be less messy.
5787,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei: Wait until you birth a child.
5788,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,cersei: You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
5789,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,sansa: I'm fit to bear children for the king?
5790,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
5791,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
5792,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,sansa: His Grace was not with you?
5793,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."

5796,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
5797,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa,"sansa: But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
5798,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei,"cersei: You can try, little dove."

5800,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Cinda Lannister.
5801,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: Is she the fat one?
5802,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
5803,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
5804,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: I squired for you once, you know."
5805,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: When?
5806,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
5807,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
5808,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
5809,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
5810,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Bryan.
5811,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
5812,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
5813,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: You didn't, though."
5814,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: You really remember?
5815,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
5816,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: When I think back to that day-
5817,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,guard: Shh!
5818,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: You were saying?
5819,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
5820,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
5821,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
5822,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: I understand completely.
5823,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
5824,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
5825,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Which knight was it?
5826,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
5827,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: What was he like?
5828,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
5829,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: It's hard to put into words.
5830,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
5831,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
5832,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Did you squire for him again?
5833,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
5834,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,"jaime: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
5835,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: And have you thought about
5836,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime,jaime: Of course. Every day.
5837,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: And?

The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle.

6136,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: For questioning?
6137,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn: No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6138,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: We talked about this.
6139,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6140,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6141,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6142,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6143,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6144,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6145,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn: We could throw books at his men.
6146,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: We don't have that many books.
6147,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: We don't have that many men, either."
6148,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: What do we have?
6149,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Pig shit.
6150,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6151,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous: I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6152,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6153,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous: You lack imagination.
6154,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: Where do you think Jon is right now?
6155,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous: He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6156,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,"sam: He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6157,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,"grenn: Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6158,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6159,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,eddision,eddision: So did his father.
6160,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6161,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous: Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6162,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: What in seven hells is that?
6163,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6164,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: Look.
6165,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,"dolorous: If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6166,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6167,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: It's been here a long time.
6168,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: Oh. Must be dragonglass.
6169,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: Dragonglass?
6170,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,sam: The maesters call it obsidian.
6171,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,grenn: Why would a brother hide it here?
6172,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous,dolorous: I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6173,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,soldier: Mind where you're going.
6174,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: I'm sorry. I'll-
6175,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: Where were you?
6176,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: A man has patrol duty.
6177,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya: Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6178,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6179,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6180,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen: A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6181,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6182,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: This a man cannot do.
6183,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: You promised you'd help me.
6184,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen: Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6185,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6186,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen: By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6187,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6188,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: A girl gives a man his own name?
6189,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: That's right.
6190,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6191,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6192,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: Un-name me.
6193,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: No.
6194,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: Please?
6195,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: I'll un-name you.
6196,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: Thank you.
6197,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: If you help me and my friends escape.
6198,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6199,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya: Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6200,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,"jaqen: A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6201,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: A girl will obey.
6202,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen,jaqen: A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6203,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: Thank you, Podrick."
6204,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Odd little boy.
6205,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6206,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You and Varys both.
6207,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6208,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: He's only a boy.
6209,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6210,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: He's not ready.
6211,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6212,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6213,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6214,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Do you think I'm an idiot?
6215,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6216,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6217,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6218,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6219,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6220,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Because he doesn't have a cock.
6221,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Neither do you.
6222,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6223,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: It's not that little.
6224,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Why are you smiling?
6225,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Because I'm happy.
6226,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: And why are you happy?
6227,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Because I have your little whore.
6228,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I thought you preferred blondes.
6229,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6230,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Why do you care who I fuck?
6231,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6232,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6233,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6234,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Where did you find her?
6235,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6236,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6237,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6238,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6239,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6240,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6241,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6242,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6243,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I promise I will free you.
6244,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ros,ros: Don't forget me.
6245,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Never.
6246,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6247,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Get out.
6248,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Shae!
6249,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae: I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6250,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: You're beautiful.
6251,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae: Then why do you look sad?
6252,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: We have to be more careful.
6253,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae: Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6254,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: There are people who want to hurt me.
6255,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,shae: I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6256,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.

6261,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose: We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6262,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6263,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose,roose: He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6264,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

6271,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6272,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6273,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6274,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: You have every right. You're a king.
6275,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6276,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: What kind do you want to be?
6277,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6278,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa: I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6279,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: I'd like to hear you play the harp.

6281,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb,robb: How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6282,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa: When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."

6289,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara,yara: Shut up. What did you bring?
6290,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,hot: The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6291,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry: What did he want us to do about those guards?
6292,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,"arya: He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6293,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry: What about the guards?
6294,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: He didn't say anything about the guards.
6295,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,"gendry: What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6296,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: We have to trust him.
6297,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry,gendry: Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6298,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot,hot: I want to go back to the kitchens.
6299,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya,arya: Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

6308,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis: Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6309,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6310,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: Do you? Why?
6311,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: My father was a crabber.
6312,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: And?
6313,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6314,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6315,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6316,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6317,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: Some are happy to do it to my face.
6318,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis: We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6319,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6320,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6321,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: He was only a boy.
6322,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6323,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis: First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6324,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6325,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6326,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: I was relieved they did not.
6327,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,"stannis: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6328,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6329,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis,stannis: I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6330,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey: You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6331,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6332,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey: The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6333,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6334,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,"joffrey: If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6335,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6336,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey,joffrey: They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6337,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Imagine Stannis' terror.
6338,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: I am trying.
6339,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6340,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6341,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6342,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: I wish we could, too."
6343,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: What do you want? Tell me.
6344,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6345,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6346,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: A most highborn plumber.
6347,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6348,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6349,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I do. Last thing I expected.
6350,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: And you play it well.
6351,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6352,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,varys: They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6353,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6354,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6355,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: We should sail there immediately.
6356,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6357,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6358,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6359,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: One game at a time, my friend."
6360,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah: Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6361,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: Astapor?
6362,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,jorah: We cannot stay here.
6363,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6364,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah: They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6365,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6366,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah: You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6367,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,"daenerys: Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6368,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah: That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6369,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6370,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah,"jorah: Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6371,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6372,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon: We should bury them.
6373,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,dagmer: I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6374,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,"theon: If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."

6376,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon,theon: Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6377,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,dagmer: His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6378,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,"dagmer: His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6379,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha: Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6380,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin: You're right so far.
6381,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha: Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6382,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin: Must have been the farmer's boys.
6383,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha: He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6384,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,luwin: They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6385,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6386,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: That's it. The tide's against us.
6387,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6388,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: You're coming home.
6389,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6390,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6391,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."

6394,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6395,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: But not over them?
6396,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6397,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Well, first, we have to put it there."
6398,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6399,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6400,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.

6402,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."

6404,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6405,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: It is now.

6424,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Thank you very much.
6425,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6426,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6427,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: Oh.
6428,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6429,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6430,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6431,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: Poor nose.
6432,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6433,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
6434,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I don't think he likes me.
6435,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor: You think you're a hard man?
6436,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I know it.
6437,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6438,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,"sandor: Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6439,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor: Only smaller.
6440,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: And quicker. Eh?
6441,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor: Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6442,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Aye I expect he will someday.
6443,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,man: Here we are.
6444,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6445,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6446,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: A wedding.
6447,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6448,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6449,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6450,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6451,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Do you trust him?
6452,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Oddly enough, I do."
6453,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Good.
6454,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: The map you asked for.
6455,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6456,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6457,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6458,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6459,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, I'm not."
6460,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6461,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: What of it?
6462,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6463,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6464,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6465,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6466,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6467,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: No, I don't believe you have."
6468,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6469,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: They're welcoming the new king.
6470,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6471,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: Drums!
6472,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Remember, wait till the ships-"
6473,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: The ships are in the bay.
6474,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: They must be far enough in-
6475,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6476,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6477,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6478,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Don't get killed.
6479,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Nor you, my friend."
6480,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Oh, are we friends now?"
6481,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6482,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Enhances it, really."
6483,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6484,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Been spending time with fancy folks.
6485,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6486,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Shae.
6487,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6488,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa: She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6489,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: Sansa.
6490,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6491,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey: Sansa, come here."
6492,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa: I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6493,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: Will you?
6494,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Just as I pray for the king's.
6495,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Stay safe, my lady."
6496,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: And you, my lion."
6497,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6498,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey: My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6499,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6500,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Will you slay him yourself?
6501,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6502,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6503,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6504,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,"sansa: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6505,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey: Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6506,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Some of those boys will never come back.
6507,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6508,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: Shh. Come, my lady."
6509,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,lancel: Where's our fleet?
6510,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: On the way.
6511,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6512,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey: Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6513,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor,sandor: The king has asked you a question.
6514,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6515,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,lancel: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6516,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,"joffrey: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6517,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,"tyrion: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6518,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Where are their ships?
6519,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6520,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6521,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6522,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Maybe.
6523,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6524,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6525,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: I doubt it.
6526,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Maybe she's jealous of you.
6527,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Why would she be jealous?
6528,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei: Sansa.
6529,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6530,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Yes.
6531,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6532,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6533,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei: So? I didn't offer you water.
6534,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: What's he doing here?
6535,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6536,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: But we have guards to defend us.
6537,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,"cersei: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6538,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,gold,gold: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6539,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei: The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6540,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei: The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6541,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: You said he was here to protect us.
6542,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei,cersei: He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6543,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey,joffrey: There they are.
6544,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion,tyrion: Archers to their marks.

My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6583,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa,sansa: Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

6831,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime,jaime: For stealing a pig?
6832,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,brienne: I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.

6860,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb,robb: It is important to me.
6861,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn,"catelyn: Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
6862,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb,"robb: And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"

6868,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,melisandre: l I did. I still see it.
6869,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis,"stannis: The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
6870,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,melisandre: The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

6873,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis,stannis: You talk about war as if you understand it.

You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.

7189,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7190,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei: Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."

7219,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,bronn: Which means you can afford it.

7226,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: He may have swam ashore as you did.
7227,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos: No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7228,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."

7230,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7231,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: Will you take me there?
7232,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

7236,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7237,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7238,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7239,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: What?
7240,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7241,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: I'm a pirate.
7242,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: You're a smuggler.
7243,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7244,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos: Take me back there, please."
7245,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: You cannot turn Stannis against her.
7246,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos: Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7247,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7248,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7249,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."

7251,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7252,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose: We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7253,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb: There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7254,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose: I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7255,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb: The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7256,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard,rickard: Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7257,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,"roose: The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7258,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard,rickard: Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7259,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose,roose: The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7260,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb: A Mallister?
7261,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,catelyn,catelyn: Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7262,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb: Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7263,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,talisa: She's your mother.
7264,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb,robb: She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.

7266,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,talisa: This needs to be cleaned and closed.

7268,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,qyburn: Qyburn.

7271,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7272,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin: Am I enjoying it?
7273,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: I was very happy as Hand of the King.

7275,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin: blows on his paper to dry the ink.
7276,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin: You brought a whore into my bed.
7277,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: It wasn't your bed at the time.
7278,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin: I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7279,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
7280,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin: What do you want, Tyrion?"
7281,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7282,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin: Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7283,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion: I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7284,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin: Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7285,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,"tyrion: I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7286,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,tywin: You want Casterly Rock?
7287,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: It is mine by right.

And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7289,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion,tyrion: Why?
7290,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin,"tywin: Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."

7294,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa: It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7295,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae: I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.

7301,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"shae: Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7302,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa: That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7303,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae: Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7304,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa,sansa: Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7305,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr,petyr: Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.

7342,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,davos: By burning prisoners alive?

7344,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"davos: I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."

7347,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"melisandre: Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."

7368,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey,joffrey: No.
7369,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,child: He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.

7375,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,margaery: And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.

7377,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,"margaery: You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."

7383,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei: Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."

7385,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey,"joffrey: Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
7386,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,"margaery: I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
7387,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,loras: Yes.
7388,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,"margaery: Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7389,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,cersei: You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7390,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,margaery: Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.

7392,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,margaery: The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7393,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei: An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7394,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey,joffrey: My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7395,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei,"cersei: You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
7396,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery,"margaery: Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
7397,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey,"joffrey: Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."

7403,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."

7405,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
7406,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
7407,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah,jorah: Even the bravest men fear death.
7408,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: The knight says even brave men fear death.

7410,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: Truly, master?"
7411,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys,"kraznys: No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
7412,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
7413,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys,kraznys: Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
7414,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."

7416,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys,kraznys: She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
7417,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: My master points out that men don't need nipples.

7420,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
7421,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys,"daenerys: You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
7422,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
7423,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys,kraznys: What a soft mewling fool this one is.
7424,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"missandei: My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."

7428,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,missandei: Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.

7435,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah,jorah: You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7436,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah,jorah: You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.

7484,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7485,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: I want to do this.
7486,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7487,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Yes.
7488,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: So how shall we pass the time?
7489,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: By putting one foot in front of the other.
7490,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: It's going to be a very dull walk.
7491,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7492,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7493,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7494,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: All the good it's done her.
7495,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7496,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7497,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7498,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: How would you know?
7499,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7500,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Move.
7501,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Were you pledged to Stannis?
7502,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: Gods, no."
7503,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7504,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Shut your mouth.
7505,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7506,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7507,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7508,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I did not fancy him.
7509,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Oh, gods, you did."
7510,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7511,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7512,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7513,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7514,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Shut your mouth!
7515,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7516,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man: Where are you headed, then?"
7517,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: South. You?
7518,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man: Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
7519,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: No, you really can't."
7520,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man: Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
7521,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: And you.
7522,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: He knows who I am.
7523,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: He doesn't.
7524,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7525,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7526,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7527,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Make it tighter here.
7528,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7529,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7530,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tailor,"tailor: Yes, Your Grace."
7531,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Bloody flowers. On the king.
7532,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7533,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: Tell me what you think of her.
7534,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Who?
7535,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: Margaery.
7536,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey: She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7537,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,"cersei: It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7538,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey: Yes, she is."
7539,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7540,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Not to me.
7541,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7542,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7543,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7544,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7545,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei,cersei: You need to ask yourself
7546,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: I don't need to do anything.
7547,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Better. Much better.
7548,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: I still don't believe it.
7549,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7550,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7551,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7552,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: Love is not the thing he wants.
7553,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: He's too old.
7554,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7555,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: No.
7556,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7557,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7558,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"guard: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
7559,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Send him in.
7560,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras: Lady Sansa.
7561,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Ser Loras.

7563,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"loras: I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7564,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa: You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7565,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras: Of course I did.
7566,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: It's more your color. You take it.
7567,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",maid,maid: Thank you.
7568,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: You're such a dear.
7569,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,loras: I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7570,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa: Thank you, Ser Loras."
7571,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."

7573,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7574,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa: And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7575,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7576,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7577,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7578,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7579,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7580,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Lemon cake's my favorite.
7581,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7582,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7583,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: I haven't had the pleasure.
7584,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7585,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa: I-, I-"
7586,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7587,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: Has he ripped out your tongue?
7588,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,"sansa: Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7589,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7590,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.

7593,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7594,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7595,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: My father always told the truth.
7596,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,"olenna: Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7597,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7598,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna,olenna: Go on.
7599,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa,sansa: I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.

7608,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard: Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7609,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard: Then it's a distraction.

7615,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard,rickard: I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.

7629,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,talisa: Did they work?
7630,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,catelyn: After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
7631,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,"catelyn: Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
7632,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,talisa: Which boy?
7633,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,"catelyn: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
7634,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,talisa: And he lived.
7635,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn,catelyn: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
7636,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,mance: Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
7637,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon,jon: Yes.
7638,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"mance: You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."

They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
7643,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon,jon: No.
7644,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,mance: I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.

7646,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon,jon: What's wrong with him?
7647,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"mance: He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."

There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."

7695,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: I'm not listening.
7696,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
7697,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: Shut up.
7698,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

7700,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: But you could have ended the war.

7704,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: Maybe we already passed it.
7705,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,"arya: It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."

7718,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
7719,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: What friends?
7720,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,anguy: The fat to your left and the lad beside him.

7723,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
7724,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,"arya: No, who do you fight for?"
7725,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
7726,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hot,hot: I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
7727,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."

7729,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"anguy: When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
7730,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,anguy: Half the country's starving and look at this one.
7731,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.

7737,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
7738,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: All right. What is this problem?
7739,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."

7746,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."

7749,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
7750,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: And was she good? Did you like her?
7751,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
7752,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
7753,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
7754,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: We have to protect her.
7755,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
7756,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
7757,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
7758,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: You pervert. You want her? This child?
7759,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: I don't even want to talk about her.
7760,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: But you are.
7761,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: Only because you're making me.
7762,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
7763,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,tyrion: This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
7764,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
7765,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion,"tyrion: Hmm, yes."

7775,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
7776,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?

7779,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
7780,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: You failed to do this.
7781,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
7782,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
7783,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
7784,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: What makes you say this?
7785,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
7786,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,"joffrey: No, he was a known degenerate."
7787,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
7788,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
7789,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
7790,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: You are the king.
7791,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Yes. I am.
7792,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
7793,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
7794,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
7795,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: The bolt goes here.
7796,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: And then you just aim and-
7797,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
7798,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: It's not unheard of.
7799,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: My father would never let me before-
7800,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
7801,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: May I? Please.
7802,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,margaery: I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
7803,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
7804,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery,"margaery: I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
7805,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey,joffrey: Yes.

7808,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Tell us the truth.
7809,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: About what?
7810,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: I don't know what you want.
7811,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: I want the truth.
7812,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: What truth?
7813,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Why'd you take Winterfell?
7814,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: I took it to-I took it-
7815,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Who gave the orders?
7816,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: No one. I took it on my own.
7817,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Why?
7818,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: To take the North while it was vulnerable.
7819,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: What were you going to do once you took it?
7820,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: Hold it. Rule it.
7821,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Good. That's very good.
7822,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: Why did you do that?
7823,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
7824,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
7825,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,"theon: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
7826,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: What are you doing?
7827,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: Please.
7828,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,"theon: I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."

7830,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,theon: Yara?
7831,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay,ramsay: I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
7832,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon,"theon: No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
7833,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"osha: Rickon, stay with us."
7834,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
7835,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
7836,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: Only when I'm asleep.
7837,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
7838,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
7839,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: A three-eyed raven?
7840,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: You've seen it?
7841,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
7842,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: Does it have anything to do with warging?
7843,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
7844,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
7845,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
7846,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha: What's he telling him?
7847,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Why don't you ask?
7848,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"osha: Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
7849,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Where's the shame in that?
7850,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha: Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
7851,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
7852,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,"bran: When my father died, I dreamt it."
7853,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
7854,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,"bran: You have the sight, too?"
7855,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
7856,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
7857,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Yeah.
7858,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
7859,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
7860,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran,bran: What else have you seen?
7861,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Only one thing that matters-you.
7862,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
7863,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: I don't drink ale.
7864,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
7865,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,man: Yeah!
7866,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
7867,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: We're not children.
7868,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
7869,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
7870,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
7871,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
7872,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
7873,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry,gendry: That's because he's twice as good.
7874,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Aha! A smith and a salesman.
7875,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: Gendry stole us weapons.
7876,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
7877,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
7878,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya,arya: My brothers taught me.

7883,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: I gave you my word.

7887,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,anguy: One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
7888,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Poor man. You have my sympathy.
7889,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"

7897,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.

7901,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
7902,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
7903,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Be quick about it.
7904,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: I need to rest.

7908,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."

7910,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
7911,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
7912,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,jaime: You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
7913,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime,"jaime: Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."

7926,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,brynden: You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
7927,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"edmure: My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
7928,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb: It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
7929,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: I seized an opportunity.
7930,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb: What value was the mill?
7931,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
7932,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb: Is he there now? Of course not.
7933,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.

7944,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
7945,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb,robb: You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.

7950,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,"tywin: Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"

In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
7954,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,"tywin: Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."

The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
7960,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,tywin: Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

7962,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin,tywin: It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.

The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."

7969,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,jaime: I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
7970,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"brienne: All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."

7974,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,brienne: Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
7975,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime,"jaime: When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."

More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."

8335,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion: I don't know. Do I?
8336,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys: As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8337,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"

8339,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8340,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion,tyrion: The sorcerer.

8344,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn: They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."

8389,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: So what did they say?
8390,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: They said it was hard to describe.
8391,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8392,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8393,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys: Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8394,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"ros: He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8395,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: What makes you say so?
8396,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: His shipboard inventory.
8397,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8398,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: Former profession.
8399,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8400,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8401,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8402,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"ros: He's not interested in them, my lord."
8403,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: How do you know?
8404,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: Because I'm one of his girls.
8405,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Prodigies in odd places indeed.
8406,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gendry,gendry: What is this place?
8407,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,thoros: Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
8408,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: You look like a bunch of swineherds.
8409,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,anguy: Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
8410,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
8411,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
8412,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
8413,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: And I won't see them again.
8414,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
8415,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric: Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
8416,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
8417,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
8418,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
8419,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: You're fighting for ghosts.
8420,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric: That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
8421,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: You found god? Is that it?
8422,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
8423,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
8424,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,"thoros: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
8425,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,"anguy: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
8426,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
8427,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,thoros: House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
8428,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
8429,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,anguy: Murder is a crime.
8430,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor: I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
8431,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya,arya: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
8432,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor: Aye, he was a bleeder."
8433,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: You don't deny killing this boy?
8434,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
8435,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya,arya: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
8436,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,sandor: Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
8437,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"beric: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
8438,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor,"sandor: So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
8439,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,beric: Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
8440,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"missandei: The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."
8441,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"missandei: And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."

8539,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,"roose: Pick him up, Locke."
8540,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: You've lost a hand.
8541,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"locke: No, my lord, he has it here."
8542,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: Take this away.
8543,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,locke: Send it to his father?
8544,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
8545,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,"roose: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."

8547,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
8548,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Lord Bolton.
8549,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Is there word from the capital?
8550,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
8551,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose,roose: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
8552,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Will I die?
8553,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
8554,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
8555,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
8556,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I don't need my right hand to kill you.
8557,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
8558,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Mmm.
8559,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
8560,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: No milk of the poppy.
8561,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: There will be pain.
8562,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I'll scream.
8563,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: Quite a bit of pain.
8564,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I'll scream loudly.
8565,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei: Lord Baelish.
8566,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr: Your Grace.
8567,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
8568,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr: Of course, Your Grace."
8569,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei: I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
8570,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
8571,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
8572,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,"petyr: Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
8573,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,"cersei: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
8574,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr: I shall do my best.
8575,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei,cersei: Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
8576,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr,petyr: I assure you that it will.
8577,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
8578,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,podrick,"podrick: Pardon, my lady."
8579,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
8580,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
8581,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
8582,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
8583,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: Naturally.
8584,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
8585,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
8586,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: I understand that.
8587,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: Good.
8588,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
8589,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: And?
8590,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion: And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
8591,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
8592,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
8593,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
8594,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
8595,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
8596,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: I would.
8597,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,olenna: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
8598,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
8599,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: My lady-
8600,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
8601,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: Quite sufficient. Thank you.
8602,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna,"olenna: Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
8603,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: Give me that.
8604,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: What are you doing?
8605,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry: Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
8606,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: Why?
8607,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry: I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
8608,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,"arya: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
8609,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry: The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
8610,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: You don't have to do this.
8611,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry: I want to. They need good men.
8612,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,"arya: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
8613,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,"gendry: What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
8614,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
8615,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,"gendry: He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
8616,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: I can be your family.
8617,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry,gendry: You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
8618,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,martyn: Willem. Willem!
8619,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,willem,willem: Is this a rescue?
8620,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: Lannister filth! Take him!
8621,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,"martyn: Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
8622,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Bring them in.
8623,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
8624,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard: Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
8625,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
8626,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
8627,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: They were boys! Look at them.
8628,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
8629,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
8630,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard: It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
8631,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Leave him.
8632,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
8633,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
8634,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"man: Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
8635,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
8636,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"man: Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
8637,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,edmure: Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
8638,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
8639,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,edmure: It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
8640,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb: I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
8641,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn,catelyn: The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
8642,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"talisa: Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
8643,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
8644,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
8645,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn,catelyn: Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
8646,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,"edmure: A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
8647,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,"rickard: The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
8648,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
8649,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
8650,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb: Kneel, my lord."
8651,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,"robb: Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
8652,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard,rickard: Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
8653,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
8654,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
8655,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
8656,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: Don't think of it that way.
8657,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: But it is that way.
8658,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: It is. And it isn't.
8659,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: More is than isn't.
8660,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros: Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
8661,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: So why don't you?
8662,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: We need the gold.

8664,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: No.
8665,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
8666,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: I thought he killed you.
8667,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: He did.
8668,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya,arya: But how?
8669,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
8670,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
8671,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: How many times?
8672,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros: Five, I think. No, this makes six."
8673,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Six.
8674,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
8675,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Then I was stabbed in the belly.
8676,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
8677,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
8678,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
8679,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: And the Hound makes six.
8680,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

8684,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"thoros: I don't think it works that way, child."

8694,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: I believed that once.
8695,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse: You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
8696,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
8697,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse: No.
8698,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
8699,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse: You're doing godo s work.
8700,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
8701,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"selyse: I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."

8703,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: That's not true.
8704,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse: So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
8705,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: She's my daughter. I want to see her.
8706,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,selyse: You are a king. You don't need my permission.

8711,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: You've grown since I last saw you.
8712,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
8713,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: No.
8714,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
8715,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: He did. He fought bravely.
8716,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
8717,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,"stannis: He won't be visiting, child."
8718,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: Why not? He's my friend. Look.
8719,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
8720,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis,stannis: Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
8721,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
8722,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: What are you doing here?
8723,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
8724,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Now get out.
8725,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: There's another tub.
8726,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime: This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
8727,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Why should I care how you die?
8728,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime: You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
8729,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
8730,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Don't you mock me.
8731,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
8732,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: You need trust to have a truce.
8733,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: I trust you.
8734,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
8735,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Of course.
8736,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
8737,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,"jaime: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
8738,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
8739,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
8740,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
8741,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime,jaime: Jaime. My name is Jaime.
8742,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
8743,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos: Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
8744,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen: Shh, you'll wake Bert."
8745,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: Bert?
8746,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
8747,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
8748,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
8749,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos: I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
8750,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
8751,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: Aye. So they did.
8752,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
8753,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos: Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
8754,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: Take it. I have more.
8755,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"davos: My lady, I can't read the words."
8756,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: You can't?
8757,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
8758,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: No. No. No.
8759,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,shireen: It's easy. It'll be fun.
8760,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: Go. We can't.
8761,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen: Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
8762,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,davos: I wouldn't know where to start.
8763,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"shireen: At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
8764,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: It was a bitch of a siege.
8765,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
8766,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah: The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
8767,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
8768,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah: Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
8769,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
8770,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
8771,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: You swore an oath.
8772,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
8773,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: With all my heart.
8774,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys: These are the ones?

8776,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys: You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
8777,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys,daenerys: Remove your helmet

8784,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey,"grey: Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
8785,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: King Robert wanted her dead.
8786,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

8789,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
8790,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
8791,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
8792,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah: Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."

8794,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."

8797,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
8798,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,jorah: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
8799,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
8800,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah,"jorah: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."

8809,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb,robb: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
8810,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.

8868,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
8869,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
8870,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion,tyrion: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
8871,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.

8879,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,"tywin: Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."

8884,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin,tywin: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.

8987,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
8988,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: But I have to aim.
8989,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: Never aim.

8993,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: That's about far enough.

9000,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros: I failed.
9001,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"melisandre: You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."

9005,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,thoros: Lucky for the ladies.

9011,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros: I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
9012,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9013,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre: You've been to the other side.
9014,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."

9020,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: I don't like that woman.
9021,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: That's 'cause you're a girl.
9022,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: What does that have to do with anything?
9023,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric: Forgive me, lad."
9024,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: What are you doing? Let go of him.
9025,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
9026,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,beric: We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
9027,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
9028,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya,arya: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
9029,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros: We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."

9031,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.

9040,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
9041,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9042,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Please.
9043,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Please is not a body part.
9044,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,"theon: I'll tell you everything, please."
9045,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9046,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."

If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9048,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,"theon: If I win, you'll let me go?"
9049,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
9050,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9051,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: The North.
9052,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Too vague.
9053,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Deepwood Motte.
9054,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Terrible guess.
9055,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: Now, where?"
9056,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Last Hearth.
9057,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9058,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Karhold!
9059,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9060,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: No. It was just a guess.
9061,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9062,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Torrhen Karstark.

9066,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: You're right.
9067,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon,theon: Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.

9069,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."

9071,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,ramsay: Everything I told you is a lie.
9072,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay,"ramsay: This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."

9077,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9078,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9079,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,"black: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."

9081,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9082,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black: And there's something else.
9083,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

9090,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: Could I see her first?
9091,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9092,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9093,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9094,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black,black: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9095,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9096,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"edmure: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."

9099,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9100,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9101,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9102,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,"robb: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."

9105,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,robb: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9106,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: You recall that heroic engagement?
9107,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: I had something less permanent in mind.
9108,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb,"robb: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."

9117,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,jaime: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9118,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9119,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime,"jaime: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9120,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose,roose: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.

9136,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: Old.
9137,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: Old?
9138,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9139,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9140,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9141,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9142,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9143,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: Of course.
9144,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: And you never-
9145,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: No.
9146,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: Not once? Not in any way?
9147,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: Never.
9148,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9149,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9150,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9151,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9152,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9153,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9154,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9155,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9156,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,"olenna: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9157,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9158,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9159,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: Oh
9160,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,tywin: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9161,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9162,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin,"tywin: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9163,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna,olenna: It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9164,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell: No!
9165,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell: We've gotta cut them loose!
9166,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,tormund: No!
9167,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon,jon: Take my hand!
9168,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: That's a wonderful pin.
9169,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9170,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: I'm very happy about
9171,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9172,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: I feel like I'm in a dream.
9173,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9174,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9175,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9176,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9177,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: We can have them both killed.
9178,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9179,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9180,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: On a boat you built.
9181,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9182,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9183,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9184,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9185,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9186,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: What do you want me to say?
9187,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9188,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9189,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9190,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9191,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9192,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,"cersei: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9193,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9194,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei,cersei: Who's going to tell her?
9195,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: Do you think people will like it?
9196,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: I don't think they will even notice it.
9197,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9198,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: I'm sure he does.
9199,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: Will they let me invite my family?
9200,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: They haven't asked my opinion.
9201,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: But do you think they will?
9202,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: No.
9203,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,maid,"maid: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9204,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: I beg your pardon, my lady."
9205,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9206,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9207,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,sansa: Of course.
9208,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,"tyrion: Alone, if I may."
9209,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9210,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9211,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9212,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa,"sansa: It's all right, really."
9213,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion,tyrion: How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9214,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9215,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr: There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9216,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9217,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9218,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9219,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9220,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,varys: I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9221,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr: The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9222,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,varys: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9223,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9224,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,petyr: Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9225,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr,"petyr: And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
9226,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: How far are we?
9227,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: About a week, I think."
9228,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You think? You don't know?
9229,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9230,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9231,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: Most of the time, yes."
9232,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: How do the men holding the banners fight?
9233,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9234,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9235,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9236,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: So what good are they?
9237,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: They help the men march.
9238,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: How?
9239,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9240,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9241,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
9242,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: You know nothing, Jon Snow."
9243,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell: She's right, you don't."
9244,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9245,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell: Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9246,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9247,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"orell: People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
9248,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,brynden: That rain will cost us another day.
9249,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
9250,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn: Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
9251,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,brynden: Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
9252,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,"catelyn: Yes, and that is why-"
9253,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,"brynden: I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
9254,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,"talisa: I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
9255,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn: Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
9256,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,edmure,edmure: He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
9257,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn,catelyn: He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9258,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
9259,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,"robb: If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
9260,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Attack. Attack.
9261,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Who are you writing?
9262,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: My mother.
9263,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Is that Valyrian?
9264,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Gaaa.
9265,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Gaaa? Say hello for me.
9266,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Rytsas.
9267,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Ritsas.
9268,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: That was close enough.
9269,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: Does she know her daughter's a queen?
9270,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Not yet.
9271,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,"robb: That will be a surprise, I expect."
9272,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Many surprises for her.
9273,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
9274,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9275,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,robb: I will.
9276,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,talisa: I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
9277,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb,"robb: What, now? Are you certain?"

9359,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin,tywin: Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.

9420,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,shae: Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?

9433,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry,gendry: I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
9434,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"melisandre: Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."

9527,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
9528,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: Just the men who used to live here.
9529,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
9530,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: Winterfell has towers three times that size.

9538,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: Well not all girls are like you.
9539,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."

9544,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
9545,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
9546,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
9547,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
9548,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You know nothing-
9549,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
9550,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: And how do you know that?
9551,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
9552,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Mance is different.
9553,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,jon: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
9554,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You don't know that.
9555,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon,"jon: I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
9556,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: All of us.
9557,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."

9564,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
9565,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,meera,meera: Leave him alone.
9566,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: He can speak for himself.
9567,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: I don't fill his head with anything.
9568,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: So what do you talk about?
9569,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: What's happening to him and what that means.
9570,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
9571,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
9572,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.

9575,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
9576,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
9577,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
9578,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
9579,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
9580,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
9581,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran,bran: You don't understand. You don't know.
9582,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
9583,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
9584,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: How is the pain, my lord?"

9586,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: Well, we've stymied the corruption."
9587,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."

9589,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
9590,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: Faint praise, my lord."
9591,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
9592,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
9593,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: What is?
9594,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
9595,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: You performed experiments on living men.
9596,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: On dying men.
9597,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: With their permission?
9598,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
9599,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
9600,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: How many men have you killed, my lord?"
9601,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: I don't know.
9602,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Fifty? A hundred?
9603,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Countless.
9604,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: Countless has a nice ring to it.
9605,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: And how many lives have you saved?
9606,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
9607,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
9608,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: A fair offer.
9609,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
9610,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: Why not?
9611,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
9612,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: He feels he's being cheated.
9613,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: They'd be fools to kill her.

9617,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: I've left something behind.
9618,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks: Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
9619,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: And what are those orders?
9620,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks: To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
9621,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: You think you'll get a reward.
9622,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks,steelshanks: I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
9623,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime: You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."

9625,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,jaime: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.

9636,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime,"jaime: I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."

9638,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,locke: This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.

9664,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor: Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.

9666,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor,sandor: Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.

9676,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.

9722,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: No.
9723,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
9724,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: You've slaughtered many lambs?
9725,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: And none have seen the blade.
9726,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."

9728,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: They feeding you enough?
9729,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
9730,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: You don't belong in a place like this.
9731,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
9732,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: Yeah.
9733,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
9734,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: Melisandre's returned.
9735,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: I didn't know she'd been gone.
9736,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
9737,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: Why?
9738,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: She says there's power in king's blood.
9739,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: She's going to kill him.
9740,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: Sacrifice him.
9741,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
9742,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
9743,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: Because he has your blood in his veins.
9744,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: So did Renly.
9745,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
9746,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,"stannis: How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
9747,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
9748,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
9749,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
9750,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: You have little regard for your own life.
9751,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
9752,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,"stannis: I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
9753,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
9754,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: You talk too much.
9755,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
9756,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
9757,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
9758,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
9759,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero: Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
9760,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario: I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
9761,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
9762,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I fight for beauty.
9763,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: For beauty?
9764,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: We fight for gold.
9765,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
9766,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: You'll die young.
9767,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
9768,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
9769,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: She's well guarded.
9770,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
9771,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: Which one of us?
9772,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero: Close your eyes, love."
9773,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"mero: Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."

9776,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Valar morghulis.
9777,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: Lady Sansa.

9781,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa: I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
9782,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
9783,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,"sansa: I doubt that very much, my lord."
9784,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
9785,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
9786,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa,sansa: When I have to.
9787,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, today you have to."

9790,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery: It's the word that came to mind.
9791,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery: We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
9792,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei: You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
9793,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,"margaery: A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."

9795,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery: Of course. They play it so often here at court.
9796,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei: So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
9797,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,"margaery: Not as well as you, I'm sure."
9798,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,cersei: House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
9799,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei: Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
9800,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery,margaery: Gone.
9801,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei: Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
9802,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei: I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
9803,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei,"cersei: If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."

9805,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey,"joffrey: Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
9806,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,septon: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
9807,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: Could you-
9808,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: Thank you.

9811,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
9812,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
9813,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
9814,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Here, taste this."
9815,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: You think I'm trying to poison you?
9816,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: That's good.
9817,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: That's really good.
9818,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: Where do you think it's from?
9819,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: I couldn't even guess.
9820,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
9821,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry: That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
9822,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: There are no mistakes. Not for us.
9823,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
9824,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
9825,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
9826,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."

9829,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,gendry: What are you doing?
9830,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: You have to trust me.

9834,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
9835,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry: No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
9836,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
9837,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry,"gendry: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
9838,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis,stannis: The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
9839,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,olenna,"olenna: So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."

9846,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
9847,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin: This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."

9849,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin: If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."

9852,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."

9868,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin,"tywin: I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
9869,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."

9872,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
9873,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,"tyrion: I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."

9891,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
9892,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,"daenerys: Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
9893,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
9894,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
9895,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: Athjahakar.
9896,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Athjahaka.

9902,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: What do you want?
9903,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: You.
9904,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Let her go.
9905,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario: Don't scream, lovely girl."
9906,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: You were sent here to kill me?
9907,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: So why haven't you?
9908,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I don't want to.
9909,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: What do your captains have to say about that?
9910,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: You should ask them.
9911,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Why?
9912,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: We had philosophical differences.
9913,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Over what?
9914,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
9915,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: You're a strange man.
9916,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
9917,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: And this is supposed to impress me?
9918,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Yes.
9919,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
9920,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
9921,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Will you fight for me?
9922,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys,daenerys: Swear to me.
9923,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"daario: The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
9924,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion,tyrion: You really ought to knock.
9925,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,shae,shae: I brought your breakfast.
9926,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
9927,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: How hard can it be to build a fire?
9928,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
9929,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: He winked at me before.
9930,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I doubt it.
9931,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: I saw him wink at me.
9932,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: He blinked.
9933,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
9934,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: A what?
9935,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
9936,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: A wink is on purpose.
9937,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
9938,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
9939,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: What? No. This is just the way I talk.
9940,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I'll build that fire.
9941,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Don't you think he should have a name?
9942,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I don't know many boys' names.
9943,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
9944,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Craster.
9945,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
9946,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Mormont.
9947,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
9948,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Why is it a last name?
9949,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
9950,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly: His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
9951,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: No, Randyll Tarly."
9952,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Randyll is a handsome name.
9953,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Please don't name him Randyll.
9954,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Is your father cruel like mine?
9955,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Different manner of cruel.
9956,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly: Not Randyll, then."
9957,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Don't. Don't go out there.
9958,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: I'll be back. I just want to look.
9959,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
9960,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: It's come for the baby.
9961,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Stay back!
9962,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: You stay back!

9966,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb: No.
9967,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn: It's dangerous.
9968,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb: If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
9969,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn: Why are you telling me?
9970,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb: You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
9971,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb: Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
9972,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb: So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
9973,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn: We have enough men?
9974,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb: If Walder Frey cooperates.
9975,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,"catelyn: If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
9976,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,robb: We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
9977,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn,catelyn: Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
9978,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."

9980,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb: I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
9981,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."

9988,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
9989,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb,"robb: My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."

Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
9994,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
9995,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,walder: Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
9996,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."

10000,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario: There.
10001,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10002,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah: Your men but not you?
10003,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario: I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
10004,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."

10006,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10007,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10008,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,"jorah: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10009,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."

10016,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,"jorah: You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10017,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,"sam: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10018,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: How do you know all that?
10019,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,sam: I read about it in a very old book.
10020,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10021,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam,sam: Yes.
10022,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: You're like a wizard.
10023,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
10024,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10025,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,"pig: The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10026,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Need a hand?
10027,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig: Need about eight hands.
10028,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig: Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10029,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig,pig: Many thanks.
10030,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: Don't! Don't kill him.
10031,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Dead rats don't squeak.
10032,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,"arya: You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
10033,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: More than anyone you know.
10034,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
10035,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: That so?
10036,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
10037,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: That him?
10038,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: No.
10039,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Good.
10040,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
10041,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
10042,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Where are we?
10043,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,"bran: The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
10044,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
10045,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,meera: It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
10046,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: Wildlings.
10047,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,"bran: Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10048,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,rickon: Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10049,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,rickon: That's what Old Nan said.
10050,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: There's a storm coming.
10051,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: I don't see any.
10052,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,meera: It's as good a place to shelter as any.
10053,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
10054,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: Only one old man and eight good horses.
10055,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: What's one old man doing with eight horses?
10056,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: He breeds them for the Watch.
10057,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte: How's he keep folks from stealing them?
10058,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: The Watch protects him.
10059,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,"orell: Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
10060,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: And proper steel.
10061,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: Let's carve him up.
10062,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
10063,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: I keep telling you.
10064,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte: He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10065,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10066,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"tormund: I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
10067,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.
10068,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: Ygritte!
10069,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Clear the barn!

10071,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Best part of the animal.
10072,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,"sandor: Don't worry, they're still there."
10073,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: I know they're still there.
10074,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
10075,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: I'm not afraid.
10076,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,"sandor: Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
10077,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
10078,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,"arya: When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10079,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,"arya: And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
10080,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: That give you some ideas?
10081,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: Might do.
10082,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor,sandor: Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
10083,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya,arya: Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
10084,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
10085,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: How did you get past it?
10086,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10087,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10088,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Some climb straight up the ice.
10089,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
10090,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,hodor: Hodor!
10091,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
10092,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10093,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
10094,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,"meera: Well, we'll have to open them up again."

10099,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"osha: It's just thunder, sweet giant."
10100,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,hodor: Hodor.
10101,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old,old: I yield. I yield.
10102,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Wildlings.
10103,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
10104,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: Hunting.
10105,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"jojen: Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
10106,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Make him shut up. If they hear us…

10115,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,rickon: What's That?
10116,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: That's a horse dying.
10117,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,wildling: Bring them over here.
10118,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,wildling: That was the last of them. The rest are dead.
10119,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: I heard shouting up there.
10120,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Thunder.
10121,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10122,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Maybe it's ghosts.
10123,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"tormund: That won't help you, grandpa."
10124,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Where you riding?

10126,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"tormund: No, it doesn't matter now."
10127,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
10128,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: You understand.
10129,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old,old: Let me stand at least.

10136,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"jojen: You just did, with him."
10137,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: A wolf is nothing compared to that.
10138,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old,old: She looks sharp.
10139,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte: Do it. Do it.
10140,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,orell: Told ya. He's still one of them.

10144,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Kill him!
10145,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: He's one of them!
10146,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte: No!
10147,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: Do you hear me?
10148,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,tormund: You're not gonna die for one of them.
10149,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Do it. They'll find us if you don't.
10150,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon,jon: You were right the whole time.
10151,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: When you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land."

10155,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario: I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10156,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah,jorah: That's what you call a few guards?

10165,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,jojen: Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
10166,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran,bran: They can't do that north of the Wall?

10322,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: Mm-hmm.
10323,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion: Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10324,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10325,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10326,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10327,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10328,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10329,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin: To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10330,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: The Northerners will never forget.
10331,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10332,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10333,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10334,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin: One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10335,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: I will not rape her.
10336,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10337,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10338,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10339,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,tywin: Does that amuse you?
10340,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,"tyrion: No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10341,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin: Easy for me, is it?"
10342,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10343,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin,"tywin: The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10344,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: Sansa.
10345,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: It's empty.
10346,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Let's find a place to sleep.
10347,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,hodor: Hodor. Hodor.
10348,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: Don't, Hodor."
10349,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: Maybe we shouldn't stay.
10350,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: You'd rather be out there?
10351,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10352,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: I always quite liked the horrible stories.
10353,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: So did I. Once.
10354,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10355,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: No. Who's he?
10356,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10357,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
10358,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10359,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder: The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
10360,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: The Blackfish escaped.
10361,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder: An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10362,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: As you say.
10363,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder: They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10364,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: You'll be needing a new young girl.
10365,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder: Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
10366,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder: And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10367,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
10368,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder: Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10369,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder: Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
10370,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: Forever young.
10371,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder: Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10372,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10373,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,"walder: Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10374,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10375,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder,walder: Oh. And?
10376,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose,roose: Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
10377,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay: Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10378,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10379,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10380,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay: Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10381,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10382,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: But my father taught me to aim for their head.
10383,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Kill me.
10384,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay: Sorry, what?"
10385,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: A little louder.
10386,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Kill me!
10387,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: You're no good to me dead. We need you.
10388,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,"ramsay: You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
10389,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: Stinking meat.
10390,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
10391,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Theon Greyjoy.
10392,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: What's your name?
10393,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Th- Theon Greyjoy.
10394,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Please.
10395,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay,ramsay: What is your name?!
10396,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon,theon: Reek. My name is Reek.
10397,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: Hodor.
10398,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Don't kill me!
10399,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: Who are you?
10400,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: Sam! Sam!
10401,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: Who are you?!
10402,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: Gilly. Don't hurt us.
10403,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Where are you going?
10404,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
10405,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: My brother, he's in the Night's-"
10406,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Shush.
10407,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Who's your brother?
10408,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Doesn't matter.
10409,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
10410,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: No, I'm not."
10411,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
10412,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,hodor: Hodor.
10413,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
10414,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: Take us north of the Wall.
10415,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: What? Why in the world would you want to go-
10416,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: I don't want to. I have to.
10417,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: How did you get through the Wall?
10418,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10419,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10420,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
10421,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10422,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10423,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10424,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
10425,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: How do you know all that?
10426,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10427,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: But you're going to stop them?
10428,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
10429,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
10430,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
10431,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
10432,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Theon disobeyed my orders.
10433,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
10434,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara: He's your son.
10435,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Son? He's not a man anymore.
10436,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara: He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10437,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
10438,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara: And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10439,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara: I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
10440,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,man: Get those ropes!
10441,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara,yara: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
10442,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: What is it?
10443,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Dragonglass.
10444,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
10445,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: Why? What are they for?
10446,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Killing White Walkers.
10447,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: How do you know that?
10448,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
10449,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
10450,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10451,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,"bran: Take it, Hodor."
10452,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
10453,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran,bran: I wish I could. I really do.
10454,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: How are you keeping?
10455,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: Great. Never better.
10456,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: It was just a bit of blood.
10457,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry: I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10458,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I'm not a highborn.
10459,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: She called you Ser. I heard it.
10460,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10461,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry: Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10462,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I lived below the Street of Flour.
10463,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10464,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10465,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: Gin Alley.
10466,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."

10469,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry: You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
10470,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10471,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: So how'd you become a lord?
10472,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: Oh, that's a long story."
10473,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,"gendry: Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10474,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10475,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: You see? Highborns.
10476,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10477,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: Why did you?
10478,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10479,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: Does he?
10480,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: He's dead.
10481,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: How'd he die?
10482,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Following me.

10484,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: When I was thirteen.
10485,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: You were only a child.
10486,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10487,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10488,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10489,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10490,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10491,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: No, I expect not."
10492,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10493,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"

10495,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.

10497,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
10498,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: Why do you want me to leave?
10499,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."

10508,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
10509,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
10510,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10511,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10512,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10513,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10514,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10515,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: So she can have some happiness in her life.
10516,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: You have children. How happy would you say you are?
10517,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,"cersei: Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."

10519,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,"cersei: Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
10520,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion,tyrion: How long does it go on?
10521,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

10523,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei,cersei: Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

10526,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
10527,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."

10618,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry,gendry: Why are you doing this?
10619,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.

10633,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: There has got to be another way.
10634,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis,stannis: What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
10635,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
10636,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis,"stannis: Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
10637,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."

10639,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis,stannis: Why am I gonna need you?
10640,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,melisandre: My king.

10643,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
10644,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,"melisandre: This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
10645,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."

10668,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: Looks fresh-forged.
10669,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: It is.
10670,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
10671,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.

10673,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: From someone who no longer had need of it.
10674,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
10675,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: And now we have two.
10676,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: Two?
10677,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.

10679,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: You'll have to train your left hand.

10681,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: You'll never be as good.
10682,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
10683,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.

10687,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
10688,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: Home?
10689,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
10690,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
10691,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
10692,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
10693,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
10694,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: No.
10695,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: No?
10696,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: I don't believe I asked you a question.
10697,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: There's my answer.
10698,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: If you think your bloody honor comes before...
10699,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,"jaime: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
10700,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: What do you want?
10701,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: Supper would be nice.
10702,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,"tywin: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
10703,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: I suppose you want the sword back.
10704,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: Keep it.
10705,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin,tywin: A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
10706,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
10707,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: Please don't.
10708,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
10709,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
10710,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
10711,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
10712,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"bronn: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
10713,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
10714,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: Oh.
10715,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: Ah, here we are."

10717,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: Yellow balls?
10718,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"podrick: Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
10719,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
10720,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: I need a sigil.
10721,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
10722,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"podrick: I don't see it, my lord."
10723,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
10724,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,dornish: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
10725,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
10726,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,dornish: Will he?
10727,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: And where is Prince Oberyn?
10728,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish,"dornish: Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
10729,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
10730,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: You must be weary after such a long journey.
10731,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
10732,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,tyrion: We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
10733,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,bronn: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
10734,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion,"tyrion: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"

10737,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,ellaria: Beautiful. But pale.

10935,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: Mance sent you?
10936,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: How did you find us?
10937,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund: You came from the south, not the north."
10938,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,warg,warg: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
10939,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
10940,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: Help yourself.
10941,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
10942,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
10943,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
10944,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
10945,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: She yours?
10946,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,ygritte: I'm not anybody's.
10947,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
10948,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
10949,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."

10964,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser,alliser: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
10965,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,"jon: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
10966,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos,janos: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
10967,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,"jon: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."

10975,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,"jon: 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."

10981,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,jon: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
10982,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon,jon: Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

10988,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser,alliser: And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?

11005,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,"brienne: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."

11016,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey,joffrey: By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11017,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime,jaime: The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11018,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey,"joffrey: I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."

11041,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys,daenerys: Would you like to walk without shoes?
11042,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"daario: You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."

11322,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse: When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
11323,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis: Of course I remember.

11332,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
11333,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis,stannis: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
11334,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.

11359,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"jojen: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
11360,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,"meera: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."

11388,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."

I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
11395,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion,tyrion: My lady. My lady.
11396,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna,"olenna: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."

11409,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,loras: They certainly are.
11410,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime,"jaime: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."

11425,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.

11428,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"brienne: Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
11429,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

11438,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,pycelle: Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.

11441,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
11442,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,pycelle: I never meant to annoy anyone.
11443,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei,cersei: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.

In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."

I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust.

11542,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: No one leaves the capital! No one!

11556,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa,sansa: I didn't murder anyone.
11557,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr,"petyr: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
11558,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa,sansa: Why did you kill him?
11559,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr,petyr: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
11560,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa,sansa: He saved me.
11561,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr,"petyr: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
11562,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa,sansa: He was helping me because I saved his life.
11563,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr,"petyr: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
11564,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr,petyr: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?

11568,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
11569,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,"margaery: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
11570,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
11571,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery: What was it like?
11572,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,olenna: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
11573,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
11574,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,"olenna: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
11575,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery,margaery: But I would have been the queen.
11576,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna,olenna: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
11577,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
11578,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: I'm not trying to trick you.
11579,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: It means I'll become king.
11580,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
11581,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: A good king?
11582,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
11583,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: This is hardly the place or the time.
11584,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: Holiness?
11585,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
11586,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: Justice.
11587,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
11588,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: No.
11589,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: No.
11590,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: What about strength?
11591,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
11592,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: Wisdom.
11593,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: Yes!
11594,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: Wisdom is what makes a good king.
11595,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,tywin: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
11596,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
11597,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: A king needs a queen.
11598,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
11599,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: Yes.
11600,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin,"tywin: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
11601,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
11602,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: How are you?
11603,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen,tommen: I'm all right.
11604,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
11605,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
11606,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,septon,"septon: Yes, my lord. All of you."
11607,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei: It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
11608,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: I don't know what I saw.
11609,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
11610,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
11611,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei: I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
11612,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
11613,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,"cersei: Jaime, not here, please. Please."
11614,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
11615,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: No.
11616,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: Stop it. Stop.
11617,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: Stop. Stop. It's not right.
11618,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: It's not right. It's not right.
11619,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime,jaime: I don't care.
11620,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei,cersei: Don't.

11629,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: Far.
11630,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya: And you're sure we're going the right way?

11633,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor: Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."

11642,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
11643,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya: He's never been the same.

We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
11648,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?

11651,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.

11653,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya: Really good.
11654,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer: Did you fight at the Twins?
11655,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
11656,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,farmer: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
11657,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: Guest right don't mean much anymore.
11658,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,"farmer: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."

11661,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: How can a man not keep ale in his home?
11662,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer,"farmer: You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
11663,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
11664,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: Fair wages for fair work.
11665,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya,arya: What did you do?!
11666,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,sandor: Get your horse saddled.

11670,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor,"sandor: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."

A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.

11831,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."

11833,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn,"oberyn: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."

A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."

I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"

11852,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
11853,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.

11859,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."

11863,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
11864,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: Any other witnesses, my lord?"
11865,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

11867,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
11868,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
11869,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: Why not?
11870,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
11871,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
11872,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I'll ask, my lord."
11873,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
11874,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,tyrion: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

11878,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
11879,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: You've been good to me, my lord."
11880,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion,"tyrion: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."

Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."

11974,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey,"grey: There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."

11980,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys,"daenerys: Yes, that was it."
11981,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,barristan,"barristan: Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
11982,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys,daenerys: I will answer injustice with justice.
11983,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: What the hell was that?
11984,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn: That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
11985,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
11986,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn: You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
11987,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: You talk to my brother this way?
11988,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn: All the time. He got used to it.
11989,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Do you think he did it?
11990,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"bronn: No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
11991,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"bronn: You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
11992,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: We're done for today.
11993,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn: Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
11994,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
11995,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,bronn: Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
11996,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."

11998,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
11999,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12000,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12001,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion: Her son?
12002,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Don't. You know what's coming?
12003,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12004,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12005,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12006,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Depends. Did you do it?
12007,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion: The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12008,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12009,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, you could set me free."
12010,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: You know I can't.
12011,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion: Then there's really nothing else to say.
12012,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12013,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12014,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12015,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion: Except I didn't do it.
12016,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
12017,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12018,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,tyrion: Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12019,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion,"tyrion: No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12020,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: Where are you taking me?
12021,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12022,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: Did you kill Joffrey?
12023,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12024,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: I know it was you.
12025,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12026,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa: Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12027,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: Why not?
12028,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12029,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: Then perhaps it was your husband.
12030,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: No.
12031,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: How do you know?
12032,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: I just do.
12033,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12034,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa: The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12035,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr: A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12036,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,"sansa: I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12037,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,petyr: So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12038,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: And what do you want?
12039,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr: Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12040,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa,sansa: Who could trust you?
12041,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr,"petyr: I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12042,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery: I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12043,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12044,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna: Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12045,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12046,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12047,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna: How absentminded of me.
12048,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery: Mm-hmm.
12049,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12050,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12051,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery: Well, he could have done."
12052,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: He could have done,but he didn't."
12053,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,"margaery: You don't know, Grandmother."
12054,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,"olenna: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12055,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery,margaery: What? I don't understand.
12056,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna,olenna: Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12057,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Bring it through! And again.
12058,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Very nice. Good.
12059,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12060,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Let's see what you can do.
12061,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,"jon: Olly, you just watch for now."
12062,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,olly: I can fight.
12063,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12064,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,olly: I was!
12065,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grenn,"grenn: I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12066,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,"jon: You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
12067,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12068,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12069,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser: Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12070,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Grenn and I were helping them.
12071,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,"alliser: Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12072,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: Someone has to train them.
12073,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser: And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
12074,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser: Get back to work. Now! I said now!

12076,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,alliser: You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
12077,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos,janos: For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12078,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"locke: A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12079,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon,jon: My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.

12083,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12084,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser,"alliser: Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12085,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: Guess I was wrong.
12086,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: You sent for me, Your Grace?"

12091,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei: The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12092,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: What?
12093,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei: I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12094,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12095,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei: She hoped or did you promise?
12096,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12097,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei: So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12098,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?

12100,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,"jaime: Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12101,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei,cersei: I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12102,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime,jaime: I had to see him. I had to know for myself.

Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"

12262,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: Who told you to take the Navy?
12263,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,daario: No one.
12264,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: So why did you do it?
12265,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,daario: I heard you liked ships.
12266,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: How many ships?
12267,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan: Ninety-three, Your Grace."

12270,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
12271,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah: The Lannisters have more.
12272,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"barristan: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
12273,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
12274,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,barristan: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
12275,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,"jorah: The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
12276,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,"jorah: There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.

12278,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
12279,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
12280,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
12281,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
12282,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah,jorah: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
12283,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys,daenerys: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.

12288,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
12289,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
12290,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr: The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."

12302,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
12303,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
12304,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
12305,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: My flesh and blood.
12306,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
12307,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
12308,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Of course. I understand.
12309,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
12310,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: I would never say a thing.
12311,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
12312,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,robin: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
12313,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: They did, and my father's."
12314,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,"robin: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
12315,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Make him fly?
12316,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,robin: Through the Moon Door.
12317,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
12318,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
12319,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
12320,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: No. We never...
12321,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."

12325,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: What took you so long?
12326,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr: Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
12327,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
12328,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: Let's get married tonight.
12329,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
12330,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
12331,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr: I do think that we could wait until...
12332,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
12333,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr: Like it was yesterday.
12334,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
12335,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,petyr: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
12336,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr: Tonight it is, then."
12337,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr,"petyr: Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
12338,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
12339,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: When will the wedding take place in your mind?
12340,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
12341,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: A fortnight?
12342,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: That seems reasonable.
12343,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
12344,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: And your wedding to Loras?
12345,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Shortly after Tommen's.
12346,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Shortly?
12347,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: A fortnight.
12348,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
12349,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: We had that in common.
12350,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
12351,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Then whom can we trust?
12352,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Ourselves alone.
12353,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
12354,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Robert wasn't particularly rich.
12355,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
12356,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
12357,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
12358,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Haven't a clue.
12359,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin: Go on, your best guess."
12360,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei: Pounds, tons, ounces?"
12361,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
12362,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: That can't be.
12363,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
12364,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Then how do we pay for anything?
12365,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
12366,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: How much?
12367,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: A tremendous amount.
12368,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
12369,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,tywin: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
12370,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
12371,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
12372,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
12373,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin,"tywin: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
12374,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
12375,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,cersei: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
12376,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
12377,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,sandor: Would you shut up?
12378,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya: I can't sleep until I say the names.
12379,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,sandor: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
12380,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya: Only the ones I'm going to kill.
12381,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,"sandor: Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
12382,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,"arya: If he were here right now, what would you do?"
12383,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,"sandor: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
12384,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya: I'm almost done. Only one name left.
12385,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor,sandor: Go on.
12386,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya,arya: The Hound.
12387,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Thank you.
12388,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
12389,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Really?
12390,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
12391,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
12392,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
12393,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
12394,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
12395,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,sansa: Yes. I'm very lucky.
12396,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: He feels responsible for you.
12397,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
12398,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
12399,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa,"sansa: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
12400,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,lysa: Loved your mother.

12472,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei: Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"

12480,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei,"cersei: We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
12481,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn,"oberyn: The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."

12501,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,podrick: I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.

12647,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,tycho: That is a problem for another time.
12648,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"davos: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis.

12710,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay,ramsay: I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.

12712,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay,ramsay: Theon Greyjoy.

12734,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,hizdahr: What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
12735,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys,daenerys: And what traditions do you speak of?
12736,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"hizdahr: The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."

12753,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
12754,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.

12760,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"varys: She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."

12762,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,pycelle: Mormont is spying on her for us.
12763,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"varys: No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
12764,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,cersei: He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
12765,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
12766,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,cersei: Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.

12769,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.

12781,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
12782,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: Most of us aren't princes.

12784,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.

12787,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: One you don't like telling people.
12788,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: People I trust.
12789,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,"oberyn: My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."

12794,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: Nothing.
12795,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: Everybody is interested in something.
12796,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"varys: Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
12797,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: Such as?

12811,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
12812,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: The crown may call its first witness.
12813,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,meryn,"meryn: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."

12828,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,cersei: I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.

12830,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei,"cersei: Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."

12836,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,mace: And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
12837,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,varys: Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.

12841,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"

12845,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,guard,guard: Clear the court!
12846,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: You'd condemn your own son to death?
12847,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
12848,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
12849,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: I know nothing of the sort.
12850,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: You've always hated Tyrion.
12851,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: He killed his king.
12852,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
12853,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
12854,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: Justice?
12855,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,"tywin: I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."

12858,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,"jaime: Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
12859,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: I'm well aware of your oath.
12860,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
12861,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
12862,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
12863,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Done.
12864,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,"tywin: When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."

12870,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,"jaime: When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
12871,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
12872,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
12873,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: How do you know?
12874,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: Do you trust me?
12875,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime,jaime: Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.

12878,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: Shae.
12879,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
12880,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: I swear it.
12881,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Do you know this man?
12882,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

12884,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
12885,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
12886,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: I know that he's guilty.
12887,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: He and Sansa planned it together.
12888,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Silence! Continue.
12889,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"shae: She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
12890,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
12891,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
12892,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.

12894,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: His whore.
12895,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: How did you come to be in his service?
12896,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"shae: He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
12897,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Silence. Silence!
12898,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: And did you?
12899,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,shae: Did I what?
12900,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn,oberyn: Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
12901,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"shae: I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
12902,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: Shae. Please don't.
12903,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"shae: I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
12904,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."

12906,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
12907,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
12908,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"

12910,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
12911,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
12912,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."

12914,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
12915,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,"tyrion: Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."

12917,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin,tywin: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
12918,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion,tyrion: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
12919,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
12920,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
12921,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,"jaime: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
12922,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
12923,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: You fell in love with a whore.
12924,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
12925,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
12926,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: At least I got to tell them what they really are.
12927,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,"jaime: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
12928,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
12929,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
12930,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
12931,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
12932,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: It is tempting.
12933,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."

12935,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
12936,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime,jaime: No. Not Ser Meryn.

12944,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor: Could be food.
12945,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: Could be soldiers.
12946,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.

12951,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying: Doesn't seem so.
12952,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
12953,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
12954,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: So why go on?
12955,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying: Habit.
12956,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: Nothing could be worse than this.
12957,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,dying: Maybe nothing is worse than this.
12958,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.

12963,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying,"dying: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."

12965,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor: So do I.
12966,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor: That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.

12968,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge: There's a price on your head.

12970,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge: The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.

12985,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: Lord Snow.
12986,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
12987,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,"jon: Come on, Ghost."
12988,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
12989,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,janos,"janos: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
12990,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: We need to prepare.
12991,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: We've been preparing.
12992,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
12993,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: And how would we range north?
12994,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: We wouldn't.
12995,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
12996,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,grenn,grenn: We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
12997,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
12998,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,"jon: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
12999,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13000,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: They won't stop them.
13001,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13002,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: The stewards.
13003,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13004,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: No.
13005,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: Who would that be?
13006,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon,jon: The builders.
13007,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13008,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,yarwick: No.
13009,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13010,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13011,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,yarwick: Aye.
13012,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: My lord.
13013,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: You have new clothes.
13014,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13015,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I sent for you days ago.
13016,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I've been a bit busy.
13017,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Doing what?
13018,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13019,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13020,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13021,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: She's dim-witted.
13022,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13023,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13024,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13025,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13026,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: Falyse is forty and barren.
13027,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13028,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13029,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13030,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13031,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13032,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13033,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13034,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13035,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13036,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13037,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13038,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13039,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13040,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Does he frighten you so much?
13041,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13042,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Because you're my friend.
13043,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13044,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13045,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I understand.
13046,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13047,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13048,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: We had some good days together.
13049,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, we did."
13050,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: What will you do?
13051,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13052,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13053,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13054,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: But your window is not.
13055,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13056,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Don't do that again.
13057,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13058,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13059,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13060,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Tell me why you're here.
13061,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13062,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13063,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13064,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13065,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: There is only one, and she does not want me."
13066,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: You swore me your sword.
13067,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: My sword is yours till the day I die.
13068,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13069,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13070,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Very well.
13071,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Do what you do best.
13072,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Take off your clothes.

13074,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: Come in, my queen. Please."
13075,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13076,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: You could never disturb me.
13077,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13078,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13079,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13080,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13081,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13082,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13083,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13084,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: Not always.
13085,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13086,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Did you use it with Stannis?
13087,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13088,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13089,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13090,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: I understand how you feel.
13091,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Hmm.
13092,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: But that is impossible.
13093,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Why?
13094,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
13095,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."

13098,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: You're here early.
13099,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: Later than some.
13100,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: You don't approve?
13101,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13102,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: You neither approve nor trust.
13103,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13104,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13105,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: I did.
13106,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: I trust you.
13107,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13108,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13109,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: You have?
13110,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: I have.
13111,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13112,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13113,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13114,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13115,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13116,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13117,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,"jorah: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13118,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13119,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah,jorah: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13120,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.

13122,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,daenerys: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13123,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys,"daenerys: Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."

13132,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13133,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,sandor: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13134,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: Why?
13135,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor,"sandor: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13136,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya,arya: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13137,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13138,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13139,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13140,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Yes, my lady."
13141,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Don't get drunk.
13142,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: No, my lady."
13143,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: Can I get you anything else?
13144,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13145,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: Thanks. I do my best.
13146,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13147,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: No.
13148,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13149,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: We're looking for someone.
13150,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13151,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13152,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13153,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13154,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13155,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13156,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: What?
13157,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: It's nothing, my lady."
13158,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13159,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13160,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13161,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13162,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13163,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: What about? Not kidney pie.
13164,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13165,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13166,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13167,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: When was that?
13168,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13169,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: So what happened to her?
13170,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: Well-
13171,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: The quick version.
13172,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,hot: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13173,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: The Hound.
13174,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot,"hot: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13175,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Um, you were saying?"
13176,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13177,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13178,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Why the Eyrie?
13179,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13180,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Sansa could be there, too."
13181,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Aye, my lady. Could be."
13182,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You sure about this?
13183,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: No.
13184,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13185,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13186,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13187,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: Your sister.
13188,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Oh.
13189,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13190,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13191,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13192,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13193,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13194,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: I think I would have remembered that.
13195,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13196,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13197,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13198,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,tyrion: That would have made things so much easier.
13199,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13200,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13201,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13202,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion,"tyrion: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13203,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,oberyn: I disagree.
13204,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn,"oberyn: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13205,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa: Hello, Robin."
13206,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: What are you doing?
13207,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13208,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: Why did you leave?
13209,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: It's a long story.
13210,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13211,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa: Yes, you certainly are."
13212,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: When will you go back?
13213,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13214,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13215,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,"sansa: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13216,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13217,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: We don't.
13218,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13219,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13220,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,"robin: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13221,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: I like the sound of that.
13222,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13223,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: All right.
13224,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: It can go in here in this big tower.
13225,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13226,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I didn't ruin it.
13227,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: You did.
13228,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13229,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13230,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I didn't ruin it!
13231,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: You're being stupid.

13235,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr,"petyr: Yes, I saw."
13236,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: I shouldn't have done that.
13237,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr,"petyr: No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13238,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: If he tells Aunt Lysa...
13239,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr,petyr: Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13240,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13241,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr,"petyr: A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13242,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa,sansa: Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
13243,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr,"petyr: I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."

The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."

First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"

13290,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,grenn: We can't even guard Mole's Town.

13293,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pyp,"pyp: Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."

13304,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.

13306,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: But you are not Dothraki.

13308,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,"daenerys: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."

13310,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: What?
13311,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: I believe he was interested.

13314,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: The...the pillar an the stones.

13318,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,grey: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
13319,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
13320,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,grey: in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.

13325,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
13326,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,"grey: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
13327,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
13328,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,grey: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
13329,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"missandei: When they cut you, do you remember that?"
13330,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
13331,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,grey: Why? Why sorry?
13332,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
13333,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,"grey: approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
13334,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,missandei: in Valyrian* Grey Worm.

13336,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey,grey: in Valyrian* So am I.
13337,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,"ramsay: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
13338,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,"theon: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
13339,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: And what are you really?
13340,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: I'm Reek.
13341,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,"ramsay: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
13342,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: Until when?
13343,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Always. Forever.
13344,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
13345,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,guard: to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
13346,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
13347,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Yes.
13348,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: And why should I believe that?
13349,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
13350,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,everyone,everyone: What is dead may never die.
13351,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
13352,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
13353,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: And what does Lord Bolton want?
13354,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
13355,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: He wants us to surrender?
13356,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,"theon: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
13357,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: shame fought with honor.
13358,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,"theon: I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
13359,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
13360,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: scared* You don't know.
13361,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: The Ironborn will not surrender.
13362,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: whispering* Reek. Reek.
13363,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
13364,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Reek.
13365,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"man: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
13366,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
13367,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,"ramsay: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
13368,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon,theon: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
13369,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: I believe we will. To our new home.
13370,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
13371,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
13372,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
13373,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
13374,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: My lord...
13375,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
13376,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
13377,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
13378,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
13379,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
13380,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
13381,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
13382,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: We were told there was a witness. A girl.
13383,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: A niece of yours, I believe."
13384,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
13385,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: We'd like to speak with her.
13386,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Let me fetch her.
13387,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
13388,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
13389,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: My lady...
13390,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: I wasn't asking you.
13391,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: He can stay.
13392,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
13393,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
13394,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
13395,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
13396,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
13397,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."

13399,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
13400,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
13401,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
13402,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Lady Sansa.
13403,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
13404,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
13405,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
13406,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
13407,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
13408,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
13409,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
13410,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
13411,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Are you questioning our courage?
13412,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
13413,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
13414,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
13415,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,"lady: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
13416,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
13417,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
13418,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
13419,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady,lady: More often they die young.
13420,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
13421,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,"lord: Aye, it's time."
13422,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
13423,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,boy,boy: Ser Barristan.
13424,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Yes? Who sent you?

13432,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Does it matter?
13433,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Have you told her?
13434,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,"ser: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
13435,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Let me speak with her in private.
13436,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: You'll never be alone with her again.
13437,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: Why did the usurper pardon you?
13438,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: If we could speak alone.
13439,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,"daenerys: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
13440,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,"ser: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
13441,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
13442,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: It is not forged.
13443,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,"daenerys: Why, then?"
13444,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,"ser: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."

13446,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Information.
13447,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: What information?
13448,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
13449,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13450,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: I...
13451,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: Yes or no?
13452,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Khaleesi.
13453,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13454,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: Yes.
13455,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
13456,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: I stopped you from drinking his wine.
13457,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: Because you knew it was poisoned.
13458,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: I suspected.
13459,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: You betrayed me from the first.

13461,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
13462,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
13463,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,daenerys: and you want me to forgive you?
13464,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser,ser: I have loved you.
13465,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,"daenerys: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."

13467,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys,"daenerys: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
13468,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,"ramsay: Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
13469,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord,lord: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
13470,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: No.
13471,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,"ramsay: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."

The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
13476,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay,ramsay: Ramsay Snow.
13477,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,roose,"roose: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."

13480,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: Yes?
13481,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
13482,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
13483,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: That's not an answer.
13484,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,"sansa: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"

13486,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: Neither do I.
13487,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
13488,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: I know what you want.

13492,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,sandor: Like what?
13493,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,"arya: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
13494,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,sandor: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
13495,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
13496,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
13497,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
13498,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
13499,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
13500,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,sandor: laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
13501,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: You should have let me burn it.
13502,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,sandor: It's a fleabite.
13503,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.

13506,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor: Aye, she'll pay."
13507,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: I've never even met her.
13508,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
13509,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya,arya: I'm not a lady.
13510,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,guard: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
13511,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor,"sandor: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."

13516,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
13517,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa,sansa: Shall we go?
13518,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
13519,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Soon.
13520,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
13521,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: I've never seen him fight.
13522,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
13523,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Oberyn believes in himself.
13524,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
13525,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Beheading.
13526,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
13527,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Cousins.
13528,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
13529,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
13530,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
13531,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,together,together: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
13532,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: Nothing made him happier.
13533,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
13534,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
13535,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,"jaime: The joke wore thin, though."
13536,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,tyrion: For you. You drifted away.
13537,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: I had other interests.
13538,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
13539,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Why?
13540,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
13541,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,jaime: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
13542,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
13543,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime,"jaime: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
13544,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion,"tyrion: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see.

Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"

13618,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
13619,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: I don't love her.

I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.

I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.

It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."

They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"

14133,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14134,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy: You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
14135,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: But I will be queen?
14136,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"maggy: Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14137,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: Will the king and I have children?
14138,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"maggy: No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14139,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: That doesn't make sense.
14140,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,maggy: Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14141,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,"melara: Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
14142,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"priest: Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
14143,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14144,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"priest: But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
14145,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,priest: From all seven kingdoms…
14146,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: They will wait.
14147,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei: He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14148,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,"jaime: What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
14149,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: They?
14150,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,jaime: All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
14151,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei: They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
14152,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime,jaime: This is exactly what they want.
14153,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14154,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,"cersei: Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14155,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Apologies.
14156,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14157,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14158,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14159,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14160,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Pentos?
14161,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14162,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Much better.
14163,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: My lord?
14164,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14165,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14166,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: In a box. Why stop now?
14167,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Because we are talking about the future of our country.
14168,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: The future is shit. Just like the past.
14169,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,prostitute,prostitute: You want the same? Same as always?
14170,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,white,white: You… you don't have to.

14173,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"barristan: Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14174,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: They've never killed before.
14175,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"barristan: It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14176,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
14177,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,"mossador: They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14178,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,"daenerys: Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14179,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey,"grey: White Rat, your grace."
14180,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14181,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,barristan: The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14182,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,mossador: Make them very angry.
14183,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14184,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,missandei: Torgo Nudho.
14185,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey,grey: Missandei hin Naath.

14187,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey,grey: Why do you come?
14188,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,"missandei: White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14189,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey,grey: I do not know. I must go.
14190,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: Get your shield up.
14191,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olly,olly: It's too heavy.
14192,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,"jon: If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
14193,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
14194,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,"gilly: Shouldn't you be training, too?"
14195,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"sam: Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14196,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,alliser: These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
14197,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,alliser: Not soldiers.
14198,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,gilly: That one hates me.
14199,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,sam: If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14200,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,sam: All the wildlings.
14201,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,gilly: Don't let them send us away.
14202,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"sam: It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
14203,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,gilly: Sam! Don't let them send us away.

14214,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,melisandre: Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14215,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: You know who rules at Winterfell now?
14216,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: Roose Bolton.
14217,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
14218,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,"jon: I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."

14220,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: They're good men.
14221,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14222,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: It's where she belonged.
14223,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14224,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
14225,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
14226,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
14227,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
14228,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,"jon: Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14229,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,"stannis: If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
14230,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: It's a fair offer. More than fair.
14231,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14232,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: I don't think that's likely.
14233,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,"stannis: You admire him, don't you?"
14234,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: I respect him.
14235,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14236,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: Your grace…
14237,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,stannis: or he burns.
14238,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: How much time do I have?
14239,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis,"stannis: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."

14241,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,yohn,yohn: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
14242,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
14243,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
14244,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,squire,squire: My lord.
14245,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master,"master: Sword up, my lord!"

14247,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14248,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr: He has other gifts.
14249,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: Does he?
14250,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr: The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
14251,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,"sansa: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
14252,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"royce: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."

14255,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"podrick: Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
14256,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
14257,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: But I'm you're squire.
14258,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Do you even know what a squire is?
14259,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: An attendant to a knight?
14260,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
14261,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"podrick: Well, where would I go?"
14262,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,"brienne: I don't care, I'm not your mother."
14263,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: You swore to find the Stark girls.
14264,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
14265,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: Sansa still might.
14266,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
14267,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
14268,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,petyr: I did.

14272,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
14273,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa,sansa: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
14274,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr,"petyr: No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."

14282,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

14288,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,kevan: Of course.
14289,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
14290,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel: It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
14291,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: What can I do for you?
14292,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel: You can forgive me.

14294,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel: I led you into the darkness.
14295,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei,cersei: I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
14296,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"lancel: I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."

14298,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"lancel: I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."

14301,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras: No it doesn't.
14302,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,olyvar: It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
14303,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras: Sandstone.

14316,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras: Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
14317,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery,margaery: In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
14318,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras: My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.

14329,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Not for a coward.
14330,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
14331,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: You never told me why you set me free.
14332,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Your brother asked me to.
14333,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: You could have said no.
14334,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
14335,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,"tyrion: Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
14336,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
14337,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
14338,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
14339,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
14340,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
14341,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: I'm not well-suited for work.
14342,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
14343,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
14344,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: I never said you were perfect.
14345,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: What is it you want exactly?
14346,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
14347,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,"tyrion: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
14348,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
14349,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
14350,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
14351,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion,tyrion: Good luck finding him.
14352,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."

14354,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.

The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."

14357,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: They did ask for some concessions.
14358,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Concessions?

14360,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
14361,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
14362,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,"daenerys: I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
14363,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
14364,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
14365,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr: In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
14366,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
14367,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: No fighting pits.
14368,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
14369,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
14370,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: If you--
14371,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: How many times must I say no before you understand?
14372,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
14373,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: You should reopen the fighting pits.
14374,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: What?
14375,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
14376,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Why?
14377,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
14378,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,"daenerys: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
14379,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
14380,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
14381,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
14382,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
14383,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
14384,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
14385,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Viserion? Rhaegal?
14386,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys,daenerys: Easy. Easy. Easy.

14394,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon,jon: Shouldn't a king be bold?

14397,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance: That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"

You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel.

14474,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,brienne: Why should you have any say in her affairs?
14475,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr,"petyr: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."

14570,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran: I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
14571,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria: You would have me go to war?
14572,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran: You would have me go to war?
14573,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria: The whole country would have you go to war.
14574,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran: Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
14575,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
14576,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"ellaria: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
14577,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,doran: I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
14578,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria: And how long will that be?
14579,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
14580,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario: Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
14581,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario: My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
14582,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey,grey: No one here. We go.
14583,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: In a hurry? You're afraid?
14584,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey,grey: Unsullied fear nothing.
14585,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
14586,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: Fear is useful that way.
14587,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"mossador: Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
14588,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: It would send a message.
14589,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
14590,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: Why?
14591,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: For one thing, he may have valuable information."
14592,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
14593,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan: How do you know that?
14594,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: Because I questioned him.
14595,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"hizdahr: And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
14596,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador: He is born free.
14597,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,hizdahr: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
14598,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
14599,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
14600,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,hizdahr: And how do you know this?
14601,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador: Everyone knows this.
14602,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"hizdahr: I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
14603,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
14604,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"mossador: I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
14605,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: Thank you all for your counsel.
14606,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
14607,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: About what?
14608,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan: About your father. About the Mad King.
14609,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
14610,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
14611,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: Go on.
14612,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
14613,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not my father.
14614,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
14615,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys,daenerys: I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
14616,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan: Your Grace.
14617,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: There's a bug.
14618,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
14619,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,"tyrion: When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
14620,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: You don't like it?
14621,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: I want to take a walk.
14622,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
14623,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,"tyrion: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
14624,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
14625,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
14626,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: The road to Meereen.
14627,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
14628,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: I told you. A ruler.
14629,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
14630,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
14631,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: I didn't rule. I was a servant.
14632,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: Still, a man of talent."
14633,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: Managed to kill a lot of people.
14634,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
14635,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
14636,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: Why?
14637,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
14638,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
14639,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: I find us repulsive.
14640,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
14641,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: You're right. Let's go for a walk.
14642,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: No.
14643,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion,tyrion: How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
14644,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: Not him.
14645,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,"meryn: Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
14646,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
14647,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hunters,"hunters: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
14648,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: Take the head.
14649,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,"qyburn: Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."

14651,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,qyburn: Over there will be fine.
14652,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,meryn: You heard the man. Over there.
14653,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: You're the Hand of the King?
14654,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
14655,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace: Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
14656,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
14657,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace: Oh, Your Grace."
14658,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
14659,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"mace: The honor is all mine, Your Grace."

14661,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
14662,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"pycelle: Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
14663,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
14664,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,pycelle: I must say I cannot see--
14665,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
14666,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
14667,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: The king is very busy at this moment.
14668,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"kevan: He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
14669,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,"cersei: He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
14670,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
14671,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
14672,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: What mission?
14673,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: That is not your concern as Master of War.
14674,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
14675,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei,cersei: You would abandon your king in his time of need?
14676,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"kevan: If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."

14678,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
14679,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"shireen: Right, very good!"

14682,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"shireen: You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."

14685,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
14686,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: How old were you when you learned to read?
14687,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: Three.
14688,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"sam: Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
14689,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
14690,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"gilly: What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
14691,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
14692,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
14693,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"shireen: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
14694,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
14695,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,sam: Did you ever see them?
14696,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"gilly: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."

14705,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,selyse: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.

14849,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.

14855,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei: There's no need for such formalities.
14856,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery,"margaery: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."

14858,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery,margaery: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
14859,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei,cersei: Remember. Anything you need.
14860,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose: We can't hold the North with terror alone.

14862,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"roose: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
14863,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,"ramsay: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."

14865,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,"ramsay: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."

14867,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,ramsay: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

14869,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
14870,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay,ramsay: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
14871,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"roose: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."

14873,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr,"petyr: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."

14886,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa,sansa: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.

Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
14892,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: How do we get through there?
14893,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: We don't. We go around. .
14894,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
14895,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
14896,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
14897,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: He hates that nickname.
14898,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
14899,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
14900,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: He borrowed it?
14901,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
14902,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: As punishment. For both of you.
14903,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
14904,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
14905,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
14906,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
14907,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
14908,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: You want to be a knight, Pod?"
14909,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: Yes.
14910,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
14911,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: Thank you.
14912,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
14913,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: I suppose that's more important.
14914,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
14915,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: I was.
14916,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
14917,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: He was.
14918,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But how did you end up serving Renly?
14919,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
14920,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
14921,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
14922,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
14923,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
14924,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: Lord Commander.
14925,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: Your Grace.
14926,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: I'd like to speak alone.

14929,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
14930,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: Say the word and you will be.
14931,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
14932,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
14933,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,"jon: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
14934,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
14935,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: I can imagine no higher praise.
14936,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,"stannis: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
14937,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,"jon: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
14938,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: Are you bored of us already?
14939,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
14940,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
14941,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: And the wildlings?
14942,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,"stannis: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
14943,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,"jon: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
14944,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
14945,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
14946,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
14947,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis,stannis: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

14950,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
14951,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: As long as he's ruling them.
14952,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
14953,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
14954,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,davos: Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

14958,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"davos: Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
14959,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon,jon: And what needs to be done?

15311,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis,"stannis: When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."

The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
15315,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa,"sansa: Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."

15330,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr,"petyr: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."

15590,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,walda: It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
15591,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa,sansa: This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
15592,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
15593,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
15594,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon,"theon: Yes, master."
15595,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: That's his new name, Reek."

15597,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
15598,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon,theon: I'm sorry.
15599,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
15600,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: Sorry about what?
15601,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon,theon: For killing your brothers.
15602,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"

15604,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: Wonderful. .

15609,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: How can you be sure?
15610,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: Sure of what?
15611,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
15612,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
15613,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: So how did you manage it?
15614,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: Manage what?
15615,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: Getting her pregnant.
15616,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
15617,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: Of course, but how did you find it?"
15618,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"roose: You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
15619,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: And if it's a boy?
15620,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: You're worried about your position.
15621,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
15622,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,roose: You've never asked me about your mother.
15623,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,"ramsay: Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
15624,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"roose: She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
15625,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay,ramsay: Yes.
15626,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: Is this every book there is?
15627,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: Every book there is?
15628,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: In the world.
15629,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
15630,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,"gilly: Where you grew up, were there more books?"
15631,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
15632,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: Where's that?
15633,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: The Citadel? In Oldtown.
15634,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: I'm sorry I don't know things.
15635,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
15636,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
15637,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: Well -
15638,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
15639,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: It's where they train the maesters.
15640,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: Like Maester Aemon?
15641,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
15642,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: Ah, Your Grace."
15643,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: You're Samwell Tarly?
15644,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: I am, Your Grace."
15645,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,"stannis: Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
15646,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: I did, Your Grace."
15647,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: How?
15648,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: With a dagger made of dragonglass.
15649,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: Dragonglass?
15650,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: What the maesters call obsidian -
15651,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
15652,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
15653,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
15654,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"sam: I've seen it, Your Grace."
15655,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: Seen what?
15656,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,sam: The army of the dead. And when they come -
15657,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,"stannis: We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
15658,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: It's time.
15659,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
15660,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,"stannis: If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
15661,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,davos: I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
15662,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,"stannis: No need, they're coming with us."
15663,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
15664,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,"stannis: Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
15665,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: As you wish, Your Grace."
15666,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,shireen: Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
15667,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,davos: Beg your pardon?
15668,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,shireen: At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
15669,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,davos: First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
15670,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,shireen: Is there going to be a battle?
15671,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
15672,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,selyse,"selyse: That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
15673,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: Yes, my queen."
15674,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,shireen: I'm not scared.
15675,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"davos: Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
15676,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,shireen: I promise.
15677,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis,stannis: I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.

15683,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey,"grey: I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
15684,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"missandei: You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
15685,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey,"grey: This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
15686,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,missandei: All men fear death.
15687,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey,"grey: No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
15688,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,missandei: Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
15689,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys,"daenerys: If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
15690,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"missandei: Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."

I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."

15695,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,hizdahr: I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
15696,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys,"daenerys: It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."

Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."

15713,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion,tyrion: The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -

15851,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
15852,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
15853,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
15854,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei: House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
15855,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
15856,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
15857,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
15858,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
15859,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
15860,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?

15862,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: Good. If there's nothing else.

15867,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
15868,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: We were fools to trust a turncloak.
15869,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
15870,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.

15883,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr,petyr: Name me Warden of the North.

15903,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,bronn: The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...

15909,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime,jaime: That's the Water Gardens.

15911,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime,jaime: I like to improvise.

15941,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,"olenna: Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
15942,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery,margaery: Everyone knew about him and Renly.
15943,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
15944,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery,margaery: But he was the king's brother.
15945,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,"olenna: And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."

15956,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna: You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
15957,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
15958,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,"olenna: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
15959,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--

15963,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,cersei: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
15964,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna,olenna: I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
15965,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei,"cersei: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."

16206,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,"daenerys: You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."

16227,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna: A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."

16284,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
16285,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: Name one more beautiful than I am.
16286,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,"bronn: Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
16287,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
16288,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: Was I?
16289,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
16290,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
16291,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: How's your arm now?
16292,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
16293,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: And how about your head?
16294,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
16295,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: Your nose is bleeding.
16296,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: It's nothing. It's the dry air.
16297,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,"tyene: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
16298,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
16299,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: Sorry? Who?
16300,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,bronn: You.
16301,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: Don't drop it.
16302,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,tyene: I think you're very handsome as well.
16303,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: I'm sorry about the locale.
16304,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna: No you're not.
16305,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: It felt like the safest place.
16306,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna: Not for your clientele, clearly."
16307,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,"petyr: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
16308,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna: You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
16309,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
16310,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna: Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
16311,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: I promise you..
16312,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,"olenna: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
16313,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
16314,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna: And what did she want?
16315,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,"petyr: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
16316,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna,olenna: What kind of gift?
16317,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr,petyr: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
16318,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,slave,"slave: Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
16319,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"owner: You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
16320,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Valar morghulis.
16321,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,men: Valar dohaeris.
16322,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Prepare yourselves.
16323,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys: Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
16324,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr: For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
16325,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Move yourselves!
16326,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
16327,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"owner: We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"

16329,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys: I think I've seen enough.
16330,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
16331,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys: I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
16332,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,tyrion: What are you doing?
16333,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys: Get him out of my sight.
16334,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jorah,"jorah: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
16335,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,tyrion: It's true. He has.
16336,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys,daenerys: Who are you?
16337,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion,"tyrion: I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
16338,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
16339,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery: I know you did this.
16340,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
16341,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,"margaery: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
16342,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
16343,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery: I don't want to see you again.
16344,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei: I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
16345,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery: Leave.
16346,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei: Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
16347,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery,margaery: Get out you hateful bitch!
16348,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,"cersei: Sleep well, sister."
16349,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Thank you. You saw her?
16350,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Yes.
16351,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: And?
16352,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
16353,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
16354,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Who will stand judge?
16355,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
16356,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Will you be one of them?
16357,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: I will.
16358,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
16359,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
16360,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: What does The Mother's mercy entail?
16361,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
16362,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
16363,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
16364,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: I think I may have heard at one point.
16365,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
16366,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Who carved this altar do you know?
16367,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: I'm afraid i don't.
16368,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
16369,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
16370,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: And he has much to say about you.
16371,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Move. Let me go immediately.
16372,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
16373,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei,cersei: Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
16374,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,end,end: EPISODE
16375,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,"jorah: Your Grace, I want to say--"
16376,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
16377,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: If only I were otherwise.
16378,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
16379,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
16380,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
16381,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
16382,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
16383,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
16384,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
16385,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
16386,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I have a very large army and very large dragons.
16387,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
16388,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
16389,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: I know.
16390,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
16391,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
16392,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
16393,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,"daenerys: Yes, many opportunities."
16394,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: And did he?
16395,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: No. Not until forced to do so.
16396,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
16397,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: So I should kill him?
16398,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
16399,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
16400,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Confess.
16401,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: My son. Let me speak to--
16402,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Confess. I meant it.
16403,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: My face will be the last thing you see before--
16404,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya: My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
16405,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya: Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
16406,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
16407,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
16408,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: How will she serve him?
16409,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
16410,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: What will she do there?
16411,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: She will see.
16412,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: See what?
16413,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
16414,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,"arya: Oysters, clams and cockles!"
16415,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
16416,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin: Your oysters fresh?
16417,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: Best in the city.
16418,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin: You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
16419,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
16420,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
16421,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin,thin: Can't do it.
16422,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,"man: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
16423,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
16424,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
16425,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: A girl tells a man that she has seen.

16427,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
16428,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
16429,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
16430,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya,arya: And then what?
16431,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: A gift for the Thin Man.
16432,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif: She is not ready.
16433,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,"jaqen: Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
16434,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif: And if she's not?
16435,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen,jaqen: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
16436,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
16437,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: The charges?
16438,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
16439,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: All lies.
16440,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
16441,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
16442,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
16443,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: Tell him I need to speak to him.
16444,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn: I implored him to visit you but he would not.
16445,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
16446,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
16447,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."

16449,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: I can't stay here.
16450,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
16451,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."

16453,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa: Why. Why Theon.
16454,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
16455,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
16456,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
16457,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
16458,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
16459,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon: They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."

16461,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa: Only what?
16462,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: I can't..
16463,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa: Tell me!
16464,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon: I can't, not unless the master says..."
16465,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Tell me, they weren't what?!"
16466,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: They weren't...
16467,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
16468,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
16469,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,sansa: You didn't…?
16470,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
16471,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,theon: I can't talk to you anymore.
16472,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa,"sansa: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
16473,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon,"theon: Not Theon, Reek!"
16474,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton,"bolton: Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
16475,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,"roose: And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
16476,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: You disagree?
16477,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,"ramsay: Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
16478,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: And what do you recommend?
16479,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,"ramsay: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
16480,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
16481,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay,ramsay: I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
16482,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
16483,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
16484,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: It's probably my safest option.
16485,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
16486,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: And what would your father do?
16487,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
16488,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Is that why you killed him?
16489,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
16490,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
16491,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
16492,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I'm terrible?
16493,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: I've heard stories.
16494,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
16495,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
16496,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Which kind is that?
16497,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
16498,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
16499,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
16500,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Perhaps it won't come to that.
16501,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
16502,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Varys? King Robert's spy master?
16503,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
16504,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
16505,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
16506,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: But you trust him?
16507,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
16508,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: The brother who killed my father.
16509,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: That's the one.
16510,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
16511,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
16512,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not going to kill you.
16513,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: No? Banish me?
16514,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: No.
16515,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
16516,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
16517,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: Advise you on what?
16518,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: How to get what I want.
16519,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
16520,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
16521,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
16522,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
16523,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
16524,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: The common people.
16525,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,"tyrion: Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
16526,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,"daenerys: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
16527,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion,tyrion: It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
16528,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
16529,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah: You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
16530,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,master: You struck me.
16531,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah: I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
16532,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,"master: You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
16533,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah,jorah: Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
16534,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Thirsty? Confess.
16535,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei: I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
16536,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,cersei: I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
16537,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei,"cersei: I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
16538,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: Does it hurt?
16539,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: No.
16540,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: Good.
16541,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: How are you?
16542,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
16543,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: You know what I mean.
16544,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I'm good.

16546,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: A little.
16547,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Me too.
16548,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Who's there?

16552,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
16553,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: Figured you were hungry.
16554,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: You're a good lad.
16555,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
16556,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I need to check on baby Sam.
16557,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Now then. How can I help?
16558,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: It's about the Lord Commander.
16559,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Yes?
16560,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
16561,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: We've been fighting them for years.
16562,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
16563,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."

16568,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
16569,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam: Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
16570,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: You believe that?
16571,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: With all my heart.

16577,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
16578,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: War.
16579,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
16580,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
16581,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: You don't give the orders here.
16582,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: I'm not giving an order.
16583,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: Why aren't you in chains?
16584,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: He's not my prisoner.
16585,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: What is he?
16586,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: We're allies.
16587,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,lord: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
16588,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: I don't fight for the crows.
16589,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
16590,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord,"lord: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
16591,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: Gather the elders and let's talk.
16592,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
16593,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: You built that wall to keep us out.
16594,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
16595,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
16596,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
16597,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
16598,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
16599,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: You saw this?
16600,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: No. But I trust the man.
16601,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: There are old stories about Dragonglass.
16602,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
16603,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
16604,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
16605,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: Come with you where?
16606,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
16607,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,"jon: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
16608,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: If…?
16609,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
16610,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: Where is Mance?
16611,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: He died.
16612,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: How?
16613,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: I put an arrow through his heart.
16614,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
16615,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
16616,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
16617,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,"jon: I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
16618,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
16619,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"tormund: He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
16620,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
16621,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
16622,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: This is the way.
16623,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wildling,wildling: I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
16624,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,giant,giant: Tormund.
16625,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"loboda: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
16626,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: I fucking hate Thenns.
16627,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: How many are with us? 5000?
16628,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: I'm not good at counting.
16629,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: We're leaving too many behind.
16630,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
16631,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon,jon: And he knew them better than I ever will.
16632,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
16633,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."

16666,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis,"stannis: Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."

Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."

Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."

16875,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
16876,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion,tyrion: It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
16877,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr: I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
16878,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys: That is greatness?
16879,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

16887,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
16888,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,hizdahr: Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
16889,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys,daenerys: Someone else's reason.
16890,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"hizdahr: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do."

16928,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
16929,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon,jon: Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
16930,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."

17060,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"daario: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though.

17061,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah,jorah: He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17062,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,daario: They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.

The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."

17074,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,varys: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17075,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion,tyrion: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

18214,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei,cersei: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.

18399,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,bobono: You'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
18400,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"bobono: So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
18401,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,clarenzo: It's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
18402,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"camello: Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."

18409,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,bianca: You weren't complaining about me last night.
18410,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"bobono: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"

18417,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
18418,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
18419,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen,jaqen: A girl is not ready.
18420,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: She's a good actress.
18421,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen,jaqen: So a man has heard.
18422,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: Seems like a decent woman.
18423,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen,jaqen: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
18424,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: No. Who wants her dead?
18425,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen,jaqen: That does not matter. The price was paid.
18426,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
18427,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen,jaqen: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
18428,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya,arya: A girl has decided.

18432,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,leaf: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
18433,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran,bran: From whom?
18434,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,leaf: From you. From men.
18435,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?

18438,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,"yara: There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
18439,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,all: Aye!
18440,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara: We are a sea people.

18447,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon,"theon: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."

18455,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Nephew. Little Theon.
18456,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
18457,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Explains why you think a woman can be king.
18458,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,"yara: When did you return, Uncle?"
18459,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
18460,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara: I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
18461,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
18462,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon,"theon: That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
18463,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
18464,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
18465,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon,theon: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
18466,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: And how will she do that?
18467,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
18468,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,"euron: Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
18469,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara,yara: You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
18470,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
18471,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"aeron: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
18472,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aerson,aerson: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
18473,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

18478,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: They stole our best ships.
18479,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Won't be enough to save them.
18480,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron,euron: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
18481,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys: I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
18482,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah: You must send me away.
18483,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys: Is there a cure?
18484,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah: I don't know.
18485,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys: How long does it take?
18486,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,jorah: I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
18487,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
18488,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah,"jorah: Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
18489,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,"daenerys: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
18490,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,daenerys: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
18491,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys,"daenerys: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
18492,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
18493,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey,grey: None.
18494,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
18495,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey,"grey: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
18496,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
18497,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey,grey: For now.
18498,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: For now is the best we get in our profession.
18499,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: It's not enough.
18500,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
18501,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,"tyrion: It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
18502,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,missandei,missandei: The people know who brought them freedom.
18503,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
18504,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
18505,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: Who said anything about “him”?
18506,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"man: You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
18507,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: Welcome to Meereen.
18508,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
18509,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
18510,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
18511,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
18512,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
18513,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: Yes.
18514,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
18515,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: She did indeed.
18516,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
18517,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
18518,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
18519,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: I'd settle for obeyed.
18520,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
18521,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: That sounds most excellent --
18522,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
18523,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion,tyrion: We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
18524,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.

18528,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
18529,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?

18543,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed,threeeyed: For you to become me.

18545,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed,threeeyed: No.
18546,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon,"jon: We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
18547,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
18548,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
18549,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
18550,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."

18552,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: Precious little, my lady."
18553,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
18554,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
18555,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon,"jon: There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
18556,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."

18558,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: No, but I do."
18559,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
18560,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,davos: I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

18562,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon,jon: How do you know that?
18563,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
18564,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."

18566,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
18567,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: We can send the Blackfish a raven.
18568,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
18569,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
18570,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: What is it?
18571,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: I don't like leaving you here alone.
18572,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: With Jon?
18573,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"brienne: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
18574,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
18575,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
18576,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon,jon: New dress?
18577,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: I made it myself. Do you like it?

18579,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,"sansa: Good, because I made this for you."
18580,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa,sansa: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.

The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."

18663,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow: She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.

I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."

18962,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,"margaery: Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
18963,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: Have you lost your mind?
18964,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: and live his life as a penitent.
18965,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna: He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
18966,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: He can begin again.
18967,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: As a mindless fanatic.
18968,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: As a free man.
18969,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
18970,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.

18974,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
18975,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery,margaery: The Mother watches over us all.

18980,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"tormund: If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
18981,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim,"dim: Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
18982,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon: That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
18983,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"tormund: The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
18984,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,wun,wun: Snow.

18988,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: That is hardly your concern.
18989,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei: Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
18990,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
18991,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei: You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
18992,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,olenna: Good.
18993,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
18994,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna: I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
18995,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei,cersei: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
18996,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna: I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."

18998,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna,"olenna: What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
18999,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man: Pick the pace up. Keep going.
19000,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man: Keep it moving!
19001,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19002,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: Someone certainly does.
19003,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
19004,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
19005,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Aye, knights don't get paid."
19006,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19007,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19008,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19009,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19010,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19011,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

19014,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black,"black: You think I won't do it, old man?"
19015,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black,black: I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19016,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: Go on, then. Cut his throat."

19018,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,lothar: Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
19019,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19020,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.

19025,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"

19027,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.

19031,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19032,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black,black: Those are our siege towers- -
19033,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
19034,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19035,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: A parley or a fight?
19036,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: He's an old man.
19037,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.

19041,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19042,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon: I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19043,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
19044,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19045,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19046,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
19047,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
19048,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,"sansa: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19049,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19050,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,"jon: Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19051,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
19052,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."

19056,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19057,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
19058,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: Go on, Ser Davos."
19059,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19060,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: Is this true?
19061,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19062,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19063,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."

19065,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: 62.
19066,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: 62?
19067,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."

19071,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.
19072,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: I don't have them.
19073,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19074,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Then why are you here?
19075,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
19076,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Or you'll kill Edmure?
19077,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19078,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19079,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19080,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19081,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19082,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,"jaime: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19083,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19084,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime,jaime: You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19085,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."

19090,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19091,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
19092,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?

19096,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
19097,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19098,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19099,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: Lord Glover.
19100,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: There's nothing else to say.
19101,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,sansa: I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
19102,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"robett: Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
19103,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19104,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"robett: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
19105,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon,theon: Why did we have to come here?
19106,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,yara: Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.

19110,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,yara: Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?
19111,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
19112,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon,theon: You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
19113,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
19114,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon,theon: He'll find us.
19115,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,yara: It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.

19121,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,yara: But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
19122,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
19123,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."

19126,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands."
19127,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,yara: Are you with me? Are you really with me?
19128,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara,"yara: Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."

19130,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,sansa: And that's a good thing?
19131,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,davos: He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
19132,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
19133,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
19134,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

19137,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,davos: It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
19138,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,davos: For fuck's sake.
19139,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,sansa: So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19140,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19141,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,"sansa: Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
19142,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa,sansa: It's not enough. We need more men.
19143,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon,jon: There's no time.

19147,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."

19151,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray: I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
19152,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray: That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
19153,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
19154,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray: Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
19155,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: It's never too late to come back.
19156,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
19157,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray: Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"

19164,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,"lem: Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
19165,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"ray: I'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
19166,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,lem: Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.

19175,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: I'm done with fighting.
19176,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,sandor: Even if it's to protect yourself?
19177,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
19178,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"sandor: You don't cure it by dying, either."
19179,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.

The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."

19195,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady,lady: I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
19196,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady,"lady: So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."

19203,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady,lady: I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
19204,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya: I can't.

19250,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys: I know.
19251,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
19252,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"varys: If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
19253,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys: We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
19254,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: Most of all, we need our queen."
19255,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys: She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
19256,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,varys: I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
19257,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Varys.
19258,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: The most famous dwarf in the world.
19259,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"qyburn: Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
19260,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
19261,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"qyburn: They demand to see you, Your Grace."
19262,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
19263,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: The king is aware of their presence?
19264,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"qyburn: He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
19265,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"lancel: Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
19266,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
19267,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"lancel: Your Grace, this is not a request."
19268,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,"cersei: It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
19269,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,lancel: The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
19270,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
19271,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,lancel: He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
19272,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: Get out.
19273,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"lancel: Move aside, ser."
19274,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,lancel: Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
19275,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: I choose violence.
19276,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
19277,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick: Looks like a siege, my lady."
19278,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: You have a keen military mind, Pod."
19279,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: My lady. My lady.
19280,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,man: Who goes there? State your business!
19281,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
19282,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
19283,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
19284,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: Not yet.
19285,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Are they in there?
19286,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: Mm-hmm.
19287,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: You think they're fucking?
19288,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: What? No.
19289,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
19290,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: I'm her squire.
19291,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
19292,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: You must have shown it to her by now.
19293,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: She's training me to fight.
19294,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Is she? Oh.
19295,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
19296,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
19297,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick: Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
19298,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
19299,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: All right, let's start with your footwork."
19300,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Show me your stance.
19301,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
19302,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
19303,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
19304,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Why would you assume that?
19305,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
19306,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I don't think you know many girls like her.
19307,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
19308,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
19309,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I've come for the Blackfish.
19310,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: You're welcome to have him.
19311,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
19312,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
19313,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: The Tully army.
19314,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
19315,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
19316,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
19317,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
19318,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Exactly.
19319,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: We shouldn't argue about politics.
19320,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
19321,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
19322,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
19323,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: What do you propose?
19324,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
19325,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
19326,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
19327,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Have you ever met the Blackfish?
19328,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: No.
19329,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: He's even more stubborn than you are.
19330,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
19331,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
19332,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: You have my word. You have until nightfall.
19333,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
19334,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: It's yours. It will always be yours.
19335,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: one last thing, Ser Jaime."
19336,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: Yes, Lady Brienne?"
19337,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
19338,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Of course it does.
19339,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: To fight you.
19340,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
19341,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I've said no three times already.
19342,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
19343,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
19344,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: Double the guards tonight.
19345,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bryndel,bryndel: The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
19346,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: As I have said, my name is- -"
19347,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
19348,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: He always spoke highly of you.
19349,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
19350,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
19351,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
19352,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
19353,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: He's not my friend.
19354,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: No?
19355,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
19356,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
19357,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: She's exactly like her mother.
19358,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
19359,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: You have more than she does.
19360,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
19361,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
19362,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: What should I write?
19363,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Tell her I failed.
19364,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: There's to be a royal announcement?
19365,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: There is.
19366,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: Why wasn't I informed?
19367,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
19368,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: Where are you going?
19369,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: To stand by my son.
19370,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
19371,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen,"tommen: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
19372,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen,"tommen: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
19373,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crowd,crowd: Seven blessings.
19374,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
19375,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei,cersei: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
19376,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn: More. Much more.
19377,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: You seem happy.
19378,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
19379,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Now it's like a man reborn.
19380,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I will be happy when our queen returns.
19381,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
19382,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: Unsullied never drink.
19383,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Why not?
19384,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: Rules.
19385,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: And who made these rules? Your former masters?
19386,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
19387,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: And you? What's your excuse?
19388,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
19389,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: That's how you know it's working.
19390,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
19391,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
19392,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: Long may she reign.
19393,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Do you like it?
19394,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: Tastes like it has turned.
19395,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
19396,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
19397,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I do not know any jokes.
19398,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Grey worm?
19399,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
19400,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
19401,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: It's funnier in Westeros.
19402,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,"grey: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
19403,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: Yes.

19405,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,"tyrion: A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."

19409,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: Two translators are on a sinking ship.

19412,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: That is the worst joke I ever heard.
19413,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: You don't even know what a joke is.
19414,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
19415,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: You lied to us.
19416,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: I make joke.
19417,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: More jokes.
19418,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion,tyrion: I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
19419,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: The Masters have come for their property.

19421,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
19422,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure: I have your word?
19423,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure: Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
19424,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
19425,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure: A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
19426,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
19427,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure: Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
19428,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."

19432,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
19433,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure: Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
19434,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
19435,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.

19437,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."

19439,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."

19443,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: I'll talk about whomever I want.
19444,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
19445,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: They'd do anything to protect their babies.
19446,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,jaime: Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.

19448,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
19449,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime,"jaime: And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."

19487,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,grey: You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.

19489,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey,"grey: We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."

19496,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Any particular reason?
19497,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
19498,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.

19500,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Not anymore. They're mine.

19510,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,thoros: They die.

19514,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: I'll chop off one hand.
19515,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
19516,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Bunch of nancies.
19517,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
19518,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros: You're getting old, Clegane."

19523,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: I prefer chicken.
19524,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: You ought to join us. We could use you.
19525,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
19526,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros: Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
19527,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
19528,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: Cold winds are rising in the North.
19529,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: And you're going to go stop them?
19530,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: We need good men to help us.
19531,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
19532,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
19533,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor: I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
19534,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,"beric: Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
19535,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya,arya: Lady Crane?
19536,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,"waif: If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."

19539,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?

19543,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen,jaqen: Finally a girl is no one.

19548,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
19549,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
19550,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion: it proves that no one needs a Master.

19552,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion: Do we have a plan?
19553,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."

19556,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
19557,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: This is entirely different.
19558,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion: You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
19559,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"razdal: Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
19560,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
19561,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,yezzan: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
19562,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,"daenerys: We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
19563,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,razdal: I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
19564,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: My reign has just begun.
19565,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: Dracarys.
19566,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey,grey: You men have a choice
19567,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey,"grey: fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
19568,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
19569,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,missandei,missandei: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
19570,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
19571,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,razdal: Him. He should die.
19572,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,belicho,"belicho: Yes, him."
19573,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"razdal: He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
19574,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,yezzan: Please.
19575,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."

19579,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
19580,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
19581,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
19582,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
19583,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay: He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
19584,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: How do we know you have him?
19585,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay,"ramsay: Now, if you want to save —"

My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
19588,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
19589,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
19590,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
19591,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
19592,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
19593,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
19594,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: stares blankly at JON SNOW.
19595,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: A pincer move.
19596,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
19597,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: Good.
19598,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
19599,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
19600,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
19601,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: We should all get some sleep.
19602,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
19603,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa: So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
19604,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Aye, for what they're worth."
19605,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa: You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
19606,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: You're right.
19607,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
19608,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: He's overconfident.
19609,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
19610,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
19611,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: You don't know him.
19612,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
19613,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa: We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
19614,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: We can't give up on our brother.
19615,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
19616,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: Of course he does. What should I do differently?
19617,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
19618,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Aye, that's good advice."
19619,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: You think that's obvious?
19620,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Well, it is a bit obvious."
19621,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,"sansa: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
19622,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
19623,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa,sansa: It's not enough!
19624,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."

19629,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
19630,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
19631,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: You saw these demons?
19632,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: What?
19633,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
19634,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
19635,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."

19637,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, he's not."
19638,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
19639,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
19640,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: So what do you do all night?
19641,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

19645,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: Any advice?
19646,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: Don't lose.
19647,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,"jon: If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."

19654,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"melisandre: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
19655,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: Why?
19656,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
19657,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon,jon: What kind of god would do something like that?
19658,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: The one we've got.
19659,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
19660,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon: It was a long time ago.
19661,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
19662,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon: I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
19663,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,yara: And he paid for them.
19664,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,"tyrion: Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"

19667,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: And what's wrong with you?
19668,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon: I'm not fit to rule.
19669,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion,tyrion: We can agree upon that at least.
19670,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?

19672,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.

19675,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
19676,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys,daenerys: Will their ships be enough?

19680,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon,theon: The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
19681,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara,"yara: His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."

19768,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"qyburn: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."

You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."

19836,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,"sam: Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."

19848,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre: The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
19849,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,davos: You burned a little girl alive!
19850,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre: I only do what my Lord commands!
19851,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"davos: If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
19852,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre: We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
19853,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,davos: I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
19854,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre: So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
19855,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"davos: The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
19856,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,melisandre: I didn't lie. I was wrong.
19857,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"davos: Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"

19859,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon,jon: Do you have anything to say for yourself?

19867,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon,jon: You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
19868,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa,sansa: He did.
19869,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon,jon: And you trust him?
19870,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa,"sansa: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
19871,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon,jon: We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
19872,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa,sansa: Jon.
19873,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa,sansa: A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.

19880,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,obara,obara: Obara.
19881,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna,olenna: Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.

19885,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna,olenna: No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
19886,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,ellaria: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
19887,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna,olenna: Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
19888,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,ellaria: You're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.
19889,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna,olenna: And what is my heart's desire?
19890,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,ellaria: Vengeance. Justice.

19894,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: You're not coming with us.
19895,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"daario: New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing."
19896,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
19897,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"daario: Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them."
19898,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,"daenerys: You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."

19900,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: I don't know. Maybe no one.
19901,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
19902,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
19903,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: A king wouldn't think twice about it.
19904,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
19905,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
19906,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
19907,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: I can't.
19908,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: The dwarf told you to do this.
19909,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: No one tells me to do anything.
19910,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,daario: Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.
19911,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: Don't get angry.
19912,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"daario: I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
19913,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,"daenerys: A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."

19920,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: No tears.
19921,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion: I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
19922,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: It's not.
19923,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion: No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."

19925,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion: All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
19926,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,tyrion: Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
19927,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys,daenerys: Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.

19930,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion: For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
19931,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion,"tyrion: I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."

A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."

You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day."

20116,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20117,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20118,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime: The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20119,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: Not all of them.
20120,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: Well, it looks like all of them."
20121,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei: I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20122,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime: How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20123,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,"cersei: So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20124,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20125,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20126,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
20127,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: A queen.
20128,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20129,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20130,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20131,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,"jaime: The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20132,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20133,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime: The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20134,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron: The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20135,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime,jaime: And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20136,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20137,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: If not the most humble.
20138,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20139,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: What do you want in return?
20140,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20141,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: I decline your proposal.
20142,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron: Why?
20143,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei,cersei: You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20144,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,euron: You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20145,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron,"euron: I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20146,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20147,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Weigh that.
20148,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
20149,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20150,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: What's the weight?
20151,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Um, 147."
20152,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20153,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: I don't remember your proposition.
20154,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20155,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20156,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: No.
20157,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20158,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20159,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20160,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: Sources in the restricted area?
20161,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20162,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: So, you believe me."
20163,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20164,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20165,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20166,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Be a good lad. Clean this up.
20167,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: Nope.
20168,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,tormund: You're a lucky man.
20169,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
20170,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa: What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
20171,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20172,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa: I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20173,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20174,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa: At the moment, peace and quiet."
20175,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa: No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
20176,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: My lady.
20177,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: Why is he still here?
20178,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,"sansa: We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20179,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: He wants something.
20180,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa,sansa: I know exactly what he wants.
20181,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20182,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
20183,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: It's a new one.
20184,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
20185,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: I don't want to steal your food.
20186,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
20187,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: You heading south?
20188,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: King's Landing.
20189,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Poor girl.
20190,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,"arya: Not so bad, is it?"
20191,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20192,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20193,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
20194,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Worst place in the world.
20195,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: What are you doing in the Riverlands?
20196,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
20197,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Here you go. Guests first.
20198,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,"arya: Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
20199,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
20200,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,"arya: You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
20201,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
20202,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: 3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
20203,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
20204,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: My wife's just had our first baby.
20205,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: Boy or girl?
20206,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
20207,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: I hope it's a girl.
20208,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: Why?
20209,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
20210,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Are you old enough to drink?
20211,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
20212,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: It's really good.
20213,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
20214,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya,arya: I'm going to kill the queen.
20215,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Bad night to be outdoors.
20216,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20217,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros: You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20218,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
20219,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Why are you always in such a foul mood?
20220,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Experience.
20221,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: This seems like a good place to spend the night.
20222,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: These people don't want us here.
20223,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20224,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: I don't like the look of it.
20225,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros: For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20226,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20227,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20228,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: They don't.
20229,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20230,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: How do you think it ended for them?
20231,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: With death.
20232,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric: Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
20233,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Doesn't matter now.
20234,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric: No, doesn't matter now."
20235,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
20236,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
20237,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
20238,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
20239,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric: Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
20240,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: But there's nothing special about you.
20241,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: You're right about that.
20242,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
20243,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
20244,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: And?
20245,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
20246,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Your Lord.
20247,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
20248,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"

20251,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
20252,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
20253,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."

20258,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
20259,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
20260,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: What do you see?
20261,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Logs burning.
20262,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Keep looking. What do you see?
20263,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
20264,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: What else?
20265,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
20266,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
20267,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Thousands of them.

20270,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Burying the dead.
20271,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: You knew these people.
20272,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Not really.
20273,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
20274,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,little,little: Mom.

20278,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
20279,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly: What is it?
20280,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
20281,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly: That's dragonglass?
20282,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."

20287,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,daenerys,daenerys: Shall we begin?

20289,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
20290,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: I wish I could remember it.
20291,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
20292,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
20293,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Good.
20294,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Not so many lions.
20295,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
20296,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
20297,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
20298,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
20299,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
20300,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: No.
20301,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
20302,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: I never properly thanked you for that.
20303,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
20304,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
20305,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I did.
20306,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: And then you served the man who overthrew him?
20307,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
20308,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
20309,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
20310,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
20311,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
20312,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
20313,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
20314,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
20315,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: Which you turned to your advantage.
20316,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Who gave the order to kill me?
20317,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: King Robert.
20318,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Who hired the assassins?
20319,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
20320,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
20321,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: To keep yourself alive.
20322,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
20323,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
20324,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
20325,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
20326,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: I swear it, my queen."
20327,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
20328,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
20329,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,"grey: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
20330,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
20331,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
20332,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: I am called Melisandre.
20333,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
20334,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: No, it didn't."
20335,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
20336,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
20337,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
20338,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
20339,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: What does your Lord expect from me?
20340,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
20341,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
20342,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,"missandei: Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
20343,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
20344,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: No, but I like it better."
20345,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
20346,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
20347,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
20348,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: You know him?
20349,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
20350,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
20351,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
20352,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: He sounds like quite a man.
20353,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
20354,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
20355,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
20356,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
20357,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa: Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
20358,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: Read the last bit.
20359,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,"sansa: All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
20360,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
20361,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,"sansa: Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
20362,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
20363,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: What?
20364,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"

20366,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: No, too dangerous."
20367,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: But?
20368,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
20369,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,"cersei: If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
20370,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,"cersei: You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
20371,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,"cersei: It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."

20386,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,jaime: I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
20387,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll: Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
20388,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,"jaime: You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."

20391,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime,jaime: When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.

20400,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
20401,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
20402,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
20403,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: Come, Samwell."
20404,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
20405,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah,jorah: Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
20406,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: Mormont?
20407,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah,jorah: There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
20408,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
20409,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,"cersei: No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
20410,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,qyburn: Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
20411,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei,cersei: They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
20412,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
20413,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
20414,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever."
20415,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,"yara: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."
20416,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
20417,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria: It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
20418,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
20419,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
20420,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
20421,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
20422,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna: That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
20423,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,"daenerys: I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
20424,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,olenna: Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
20425,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
20426,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
20427,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,"tyrion: Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
20428,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,ellia: And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
20429,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: You are.
20430,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
20431,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
20432,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna: So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
20433,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion,tyrion: The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
20434,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: Do I have your support?
20435,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: You have mine.

20438,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys,daenerys: I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
20439,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna: Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
20440,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna,"olenna: He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
20441,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: Enter.

20443,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: I will see you when I return.
20444,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: But you don't know when that will be.
20445,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: No one knows.
20446,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I wish you good fortune.
20447,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: Missandei --
20448,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
20449,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: Why?
20450,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: You know why.
20451,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I don't.
20452,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: You are my weakness.
20453,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: That's what I am? Your weakness?
20454,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,"grey: When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
20455,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I believe it.
20456,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
20457,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I do too.
20458,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey,grey: No.
20459,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I want to see you. Please.
20460,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
20461,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Archmaester, I wanted to --"
20462,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: And this one.
20463,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
20464,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: I wanted to ask you --
20465,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
20466,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
20467,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: Possibly something a bit more poetic?
20468,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: We're not poets, Tarley."
20469,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
20470,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: This is your moment. Use it wisely.
20471,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
20472,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
20473,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Oh, you are?"
20474,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
20475,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: Oh.
20476,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
20477,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: Hello.
20478,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah,jorah: What are you doing?
20479,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
20480,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."

20482,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah,jorah: What is it?
20483,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
20484,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,sam: If you could take off your shirt.
20485,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."

20487,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
20488,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam,"sam: Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
20489,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
20490,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
20491,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,"man: If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
20492,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: As long as we get back there before they start.
20493,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: One more round. It's a long ride.
20494,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: Ary!

20497,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
20498,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: I didn't do that.
20499,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: You've been making pies?
20500,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: One or two.
20501,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?

20503,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?

20509,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: Why?
20510,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: I heard Cersei's queen now.
20511,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
20512,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: Hmm.
20513,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: I can't believe someone could do that.

20515,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
20516,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
20517,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: No. The Boltons are dead.
20518,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: What?

20522,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: Thanks for the pie.
20523,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot,hot: Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.

20529,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
20530,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
20531,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon: He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
20532,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
20533,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon: We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
20534,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon: But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
20535,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa: Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
20536,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: I know that.
20537,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,"sansa: She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."

20539,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yohn,"yohn: Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."

It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
20543,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa: Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
20544,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
20545,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa: You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
20546,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: I'm leaving both in good hands.
20547,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa,sansa: Whose?
20548,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,"jon: Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
20549,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,petyr: I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
20550,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,"petyr: I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
20551,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: You don't belong down here.
20552,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,petyr: Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
20553,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: I have nothing to say to you.
20554,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr,"petyr: Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
20555,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon,jon: Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
20556,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: Nymeria?
20557,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,"arya: Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
20558,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: Come with me.
20559,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya,arya: That's not you.
20560,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,nymeria: You can't have them all. It's not fair.
20561,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,obara: I'm oldest.
20562,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene: Momma will want Cersei for herself.
20563,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,obara: She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
20564,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,nymeria: The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
20565,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene: Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
20566,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,"obara: Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
20567,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,tyene: Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
20568,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria: How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
20569,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: A few times. Never stayed long.
20570,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: A boy in every port?
20571,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,"yara: A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
20572,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: Could we get some more?
20573,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: I thought it wasn't for you.
20574,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: I'm developing a taste for it.
20575,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: He's not your servant.
20576,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon,theon: It's fine.
20577,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria: So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
20578,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: Once I kill my uncle.
20579,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria: And what will you be, handsome?"
20580,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon,theon: Whatever my queen demands.
20581,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,"yara: He'll be my advisor, my protector."
20582,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"ellaria: Oh, I see. Your protector."
20583,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: So if someone gets too close to you --
20584,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: He might have to intervene.
20585,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: hold that person back.
20586,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: Until they've made their intentions known.
20587,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
20588,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: Stay here.
20589,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara,yara: Euron.

20597,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
20598,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
20599,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
20600,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
20601,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I'm Tyrion Lannister.
20602,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: Davos Seaworth.
20603,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: and DAVOS shake hands.
20604,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20605,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: Unluckily for me.
20606,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
20607,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
20608,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Of course.
20609,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"missandei: Please, this way."
20610,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
20611,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: I was born on the Island of Naarth.
20612,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
20613,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: This place has changed.
20614,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
20615,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: She is.
20616,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Does she miss me terribly?
20617,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: A sham marriage and unconsummated.
20618,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I didn't ask --
20619,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
20620,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: She's starting to let on.
20621,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
20622,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
20623,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
20624,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
20625,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
20626,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: True. But I'm not a Stark.
20627,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
20628,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
20629,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
20630,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
20631,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
20632,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
20633,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
20634,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre: Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
20635,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Why?
20636,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
20637,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: So where will you go?
20638,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: Volantis.
20639,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
20640,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre: I will return, dear spider. One last time."
20641,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: My Lady --
20642,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre: I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
20643,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"missandei: You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
20644,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: This is Jon Snow.
20645,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: He's King in the North.
20646,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
20647,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: The winds were kind, Your Grace."
20648,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
20649,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Forgive me --
20650,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
20651,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
20652,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: I wasn't there, Your Grace."
20653,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
20654,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Forever.
20655,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
20656,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I am not.
20657,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
20658,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
20659,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
20660,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
20661,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Then why are you here?
20662,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Because I need your help and you need mine.
20663,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
20664,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I did.
20665,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
20666,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: They're hard to miss.
20667,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: But still, I need your help?"
20668,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
20669,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Almost.
20670,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
20671,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
20672,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
20673,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: You told me you liked this man.
20674,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I do.
20675,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
20676,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
20677,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
20678,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
20679,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
20680,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: The dead?
20681,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Is that another figure of speech?
20682,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: The Army of the Dead is on the march.
20683,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: The Army of the Dead?

20685,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: No, I don't think you're either of those things."
20686,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
20687,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: we're finished.
20688,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
20689,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
20690,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
20691,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
20692,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
20693,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: whatever you saw beyond the wall.
20694,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
20695,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
20696,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
20697,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
20698,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
20699,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
20700,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
20701,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
20702,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: And why would I do that?
20703,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
20704,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
20705,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
20706,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Am I your prisoner?
20707,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Not yet.
20708,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
20709,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: And?
20710,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
20711,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: All of them?
20712,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: Your sister's dead?
20713,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon,theon: Euron has her.
20714,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: You saw him take her? And you got away?
20715,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon,theon: I couldn't save her. I tried.
20716,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: You wouldn't be here if you tried.
20717,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
20718,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron: I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
20719,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: Oh no!
20720,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: What a twat.
20721,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
20722,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: I give you --
20723,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
20724,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
20725,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: A bit more than a true friend.
20726,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
20727,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: There's only one reward I want.
20728,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: You shall have what your heart desires --
20729,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: when the war is won.
20730,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
20731,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron: There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
20732,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
20733,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron: Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
20734,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: Advice?
20735,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,euron: Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
20736,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron,"euron: Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
20737,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
20738,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
20739,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: It doesn't matter now.
20740,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
20741,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: I imagine she is your favorite.
20742,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
20743,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
20744,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
20745,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
20746,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
20747,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
20748,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyene,tyene: Momma!
20749,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
20750,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,qyburn: The Long Farewell.
20751,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: That's the one.
20752,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: How long does the poison take?
20753,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"qyburn: Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
20754,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: But death is certain?
20755,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"qyburn: Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
20756,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
20757,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
20758,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: No.
20759,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: Don't.
20760,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
20761,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
20762,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"messenger: Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
20763,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
20764,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"messenger: At once, Your Grace."
20765,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: No, thank you."
20766,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
20767,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
20768,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
20769,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
20770,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
20771,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
20772,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
20773,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
20774,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
20775,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
20776,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
20777,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20778,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20779,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
20780,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
20781,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,"cersei: Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
20782,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
20783,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
20784,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
20785,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Your father's daughter indeed.
20786,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei,cersei: Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
20787,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
20788,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I'm a prisoner on this island.
20789,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
20790,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Except to my ship. They took my ship.
20791,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I wouldn't say we took your ship.
20792,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
20793,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
20794,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
20795,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: You probably don't believe me.
20796,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I do actually.
20797,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
20798,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
20799,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
20800,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Good question.
20801,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
20802,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
20803,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
20804,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
20805,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,"jon: Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
20806,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
20807,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
20808,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: What do you mean?
20809,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
20810,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Dragonglass?
20811,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
20812,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
20813,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
20814,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
20815,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
20816,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
20817,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
20818,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Which wise man said this?
20819,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: I don't remember.
20820,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
20821,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
20822,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
20823,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
20824,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Amazing thing to see.
20825,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
20826,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: You lost two brothers as well?
20827,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
20828,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: You've been talking to Tyrion?
20829,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: He is my Hand.
20830,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: He enjoys talking.
20831,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: We all enjoy what we're good at.
20832,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I don't.
20833,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
20834,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I never expected that you would.
20835,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
20836,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: I haven't either.
20837,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
20838,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: Thank you.
20839,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon,jon: So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
20840,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: You better get to work, Jon Snow."
20841,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: How much do we have?
20842,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan: 4,000 bushels, My Lady."
20843,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: What does that mean?
20844,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
20845,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
20846,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,wolkan: I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
20847,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
20848,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan: No, My Lady, most likely not."
20849,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
20850,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: Very wise, My Lady."
20851,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
20852,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
20853,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: No, My Lady."
20854,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
20855,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
20856,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
20857,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr: Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
20858,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: So they should be.
20859,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr: I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
20860,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
20861,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,petyr: I only meant to say --
20862,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
20863,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,"petyr: One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
20864,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr,"petyr: Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
20865,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,guard,"guard: Lady Sansa, at the gate."
20866,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,"bran: Hello, Sansa."
20867,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: I wish Jon was here.
20868,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: Yes. I need to speak to him.
20869,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
20870,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
20871,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: I don't know what that means.
20872,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: It's difficult to explain.
20873,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: Try, please, for me."
20874,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,"bran: It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
20875,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: How do you know all of this?
20876,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: The three-eyed raven taught me.
20877,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
20878,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: I told you it's difficult to explain.
20879,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,sansa: Bran --
20880,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
20881,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa,"sansa: I have to go back inside, Bran."
20882,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran,bran: I'll stay a bit longer.
20883,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Hmm.
20884,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Hmm. Does it hurt?
20885,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: A bit. Less than before.
20886,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: The infection no longer appears to be active.
20887,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
20888,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
20889,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: And the climate.
20890,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
20891,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
20892,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: How bad is it?
20893,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: I suppose I'll find out this evening.
20894,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: Where will you go?
20895,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
20896,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: I owe my life to her and you.
20897,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
20898,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah,jorah: Perhaps our paths will cross again?
20899,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: I hope they do.
20900,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: You treated him?
20901,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: Yes.
20902,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Who told you to treat him?
20903,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: No one.
20904,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
20905,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: I seem to remember you.
20906,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: But you treated him anyway?
20907,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: I did.
20908,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
20909,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,sam: I read the books and followed the instructions.
20910,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
20911,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam,"sam: Thank you, Archmaester."
20912,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Come here.
20913,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
20914,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
20915,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
20916,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
20917,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
20918,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
20919,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,"daenerys: I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
20920,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
20921,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: It's too great a risk. You're too important.
20922,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys,daenerys: What about Casterly Rock?
20923,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: The Unsullied will be there soon.
20924,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: And what will they face?
20925,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
20926,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
20927,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: No one has ever taken the rock.
20928,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
20929,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: They will be ready.
20930,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,man,man: Draw! Loose!
20931,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
20932,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
20933,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
20934,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
20935,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
20936,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
20937,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,tyrion: And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
20938,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion,"tyrion: But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
20939,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,unsullied,unsullied: There are none left.
20940,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey,grey: There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
20941,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey,grey: Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
20942,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: It's done?
20943,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: It is.
20944,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
20945,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: I suppose as well as can be expected.
20946,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
20947,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
20948,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: So you'll just let them take it?
20949,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
20950,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna: And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
20951,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
20952,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: Yes. You must be very wise by now.
20953,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: My father always said I was a slow learner.

20955,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna: That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
20956,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: Widow's Wail.
20957,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,"olenna: He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
20958,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
20959,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
20960,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
20961,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
20962,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,"jaime: Yes, it has."
20963,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
20964,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: I think we're done here.
20965,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: How will it happen?
20966,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
20967,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: Will there be pain?
20968,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime,jaime: No. I made sure of that.
20969,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna,olenna: That's good.

It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."

20974,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
20975,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
20976,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: There is no more High Septon.
20977,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime: No, there isn't, is there?"
20978,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: There is still the question of my prize.

20980,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: That's a lot of money I just gave you.
20981,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: It's not a castle.
20982,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: turns and points to Highgarden.
20983,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: How about that one? It's available.
20984,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: You don't want Highgarden.
20985,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: I beg to differ.
20986,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime: We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
20987,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn: Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"

20989,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
20990,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: Right. Just not to me.
20991,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime: Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
20992,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn: Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
20993,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: Stranger things have happened.
20994,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: Like what?
20995,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll: TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
20996,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"randyll: The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
20997,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,jaime: The current harvest?
20998,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon: We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.

21000,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime: Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21001,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21002,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime,"jaime: No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21003,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll: My Lord.
21004,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon: My Lord.

21006,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei: and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
21007,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21008,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,"cersei: You're too kind, My Lord."
21009,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
21010,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei: Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21011,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21012,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei: We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21013,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21014,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei: My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21015,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21016,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,"cersei: It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21017,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21018,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei,cersei: That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21019,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21020,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.

21023,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr: The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21024,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,"bran: reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
21025,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr: The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21026,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: Do you know who this belonged to?
21027,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr: No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21028,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,petyr: hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
21029,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr,"petyr: To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21030,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: Chaos is a ladder.
21031,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.

21038,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21039,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera: It's a very good idea.

21050,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera: You died in that cave.

21065,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21066,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
21067,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: Which Lady Stark?

21070,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off."

21080,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,man: We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
21081,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: sighs.
21082,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."

21084,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."

21092,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: I didn't run. You need better guards.
21093,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: smirks at ARYA.
21094,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,"arya: It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"

21096,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21097,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: Everyone who knew his face is dead.
21098,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: We're not.

21102,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.

21136,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: Why?
21137,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: Because it was meant to kill me.
21138,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: The cutthroat after your fall?
21139,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya,arya: Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21140,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran,bran: Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21141,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.

21159,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei: He better.

21166,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
21167,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: It's all right.
21168,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
21169,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.

21176,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: When?
21177,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: A very long time ago.
21178,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
21179,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: No.
21180,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.

21185,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
21186,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
21187,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: turns to look at JON.
21188,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21189,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,"jon: No, I don't think I can."

21194,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21195,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,"jon: and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
21196,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: What is it?
21197,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: We took Casterly Rock.
21198,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: That's very good to hear.
21199,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
21200,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: Isn't it?
21201,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,davos: You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
21202,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21203,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: We still have the largest army.
21204,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21205,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
21206,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,"daenerys: stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
21207,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,"daenerys: The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21208,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: If I've underestimated our enemies --
21209,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,"daenerys: Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21210,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
21211,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: Enough with the clever plans.

21213,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21214,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: We've discussed this.
21215,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21216,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion,tyrion: A smart one.

21220,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: I'm at war. I'm losing.
21221,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys,daenerys: begins walking close to JON.

21223,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21224,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,jon: glances back towards the dragons.
21225,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon,"jon: But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."

21230,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Don't go where your enemy leads you.

21240,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa,sansa: If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --

21395,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: I already have a queen.
21396,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
21397,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,"randyll: There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
21398,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
21399,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: turns to speak to DAENERYS.
21400,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
21401,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
21402,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
21403,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon: You will have to kill me too.
21404,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
21405,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: Step back and shut your mouth.
21406,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: Who are you?
21407,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: A stupid boy.
21408,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,"dickon: I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
21409,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
21410,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon: looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
21411,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,dickon: I will not.
21412,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
21413,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
21414,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
21415,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
21416,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: I'm not beheading anyone.
21417,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
21418,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Your Grace --
21419,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
21420,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
21421,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
21422,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: Dracarys.
21423,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,drogon,drogon: draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
21424,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime: is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
21425,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn: My Lord.
21426,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
21427,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: How many men did we lose?
21428,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: We haven't done a full counting.
21429,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei: It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
21430,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: shakes his head.
21431,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei: They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
21432,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime: I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
21433,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei: So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
21434,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: turns and walks away from JAIME.
21435,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
21436,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: He didn't.
21437,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei: You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
21438,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
21439,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
21440,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: After all this time it still amazes me --
21441,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
21442,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
21443,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: After.
21444,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: And you believed her?
21445,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
21446,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,"cersei: looks away, then sits down."
21447,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
21448,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,"jaime: She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
21449,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei,cersei: So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
21450,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
21451,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: They're beautiful, aren't they?"
21452,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon: That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
21453,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
21454,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
21455,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: You weren't gone long.
21456,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: turns back to JON.
21457,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: No.
21458,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: And?
21459,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
21460,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: pauses and doesn't say anything.
21461,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: You're not sure how you feel about that?
21462,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon: No, I'm not."
21463,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
21464,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
21465,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: Thousands.
21466,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
21467,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: Ser Davos gets carried away.
21468,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: So it was a figure of speech?
21469,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
21470,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"guard: This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
21471,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: He is my friend.
21472,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: kneels before DAENERYS.
21473,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: Your Grace.
21474,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: stands.
21475,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
21476,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: I served with your father. He was a great man.
21477,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: nods to JON.
21478,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: You look strong. You found a cure?
21479,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,"jorah: I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
21480,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: It would be my honor.
21481,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: steps forward and hugs JORAH.
21482,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran,bran: s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
21483,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran,bran: Ravens. We need to send ravens.
21484,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,wolkan: nods his head to BRAN.
21485,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,archmaester,archmaester: MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
21486,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
21487,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
21488,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
21489,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
21490,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: stops working and turns around.
21491,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
21492,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: Brandon Stark --
21493,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: the crippled boy.
21494,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: Do you know him?
21495,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
21496,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: And?
21497,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam: Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
21498,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
21499,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
21500,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: steps forward and clears his throat.
21501,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam: Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
21502,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
21503,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
21504,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"sam: Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
21505,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
21506,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: Archmaester --
21507,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,"marwyn: That will be all, Tarley."
21508,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
21509,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
21510,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
21511,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
21512,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I'm afraid so.
21513,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Horrible business.
21514,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
21515,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
21516,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
21517,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
21518,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
21519,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Not burn him alive alongside his son.
21520,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
21521,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
21522,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys: reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
21523,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys: It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
21524,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
21525,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Daenerys is not her father.
21526,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
21527,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
21528,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Who is that for?
21529,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Jon Snow.
21530,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Did you read it?
21531,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
21532,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
21533,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: What's it say?
21534,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Nothing good.
21535,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
21536,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
21537,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
21538,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
21539,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
21540,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: interrupts VARYS.
21541,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: I need to go home.
21542,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: You said you don't have enough men.
21543,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
21544,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
21545,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
21546,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
21547,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: begins walking around the table closer to JON.
21548,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: So bring the dead to her.
21549,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
21550,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
21551,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Is that possible?
21552,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
21553,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
21554,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
21555,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
21556,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: And how would you get into King's Landing.
21557,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
21558,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: nods his head.
21559,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,"daenerys: Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
21560,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
21561,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
21562,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
21563,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: turns to look at JORAH.
21564,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
21565,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
21566,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: They won't follow Ser Jorah.
21567,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: They won't have to.
21568,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
21569,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
21570,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: I haven't given you permission to leave.
21571,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,"jon: With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
21572,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys,daenerys: pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
21573,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,robett,"robett: The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
21574,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,yohn,"yohn: The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
21575,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa: You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
21576,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
21577,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
21578,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
21579,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa: Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
21580,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: These are mother and father's chambers.
21581,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: And?
21582,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: Nothing.
21583,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: Don't do that.
21584,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: turns around to face ARYA.
21585,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: What?
21586,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: Say what you mean.
21587,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
21588,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
21589,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: Are you angry with me?
21590,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
21591,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa: I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
21592,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: Their opinions are important to you?
21593,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa: Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
21594,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: Not if they lose their heads first.
21595,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,"sansa: Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
21596,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,"arya: And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
21597,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: How can you even think such a horrible thing?
21598,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,"arya: You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
21599,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
21600,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: I have work to do.
21601,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa,sansa: turns and walks away from ARYA.
21602,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: My lady.
21603,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya,arya: exits the room.
21604,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
21605,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
21606,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
21607,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
21608,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
21609,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
21610,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: You're not staying here?
21611,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
21612,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: What if someone takes the boat?
21613,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
21614,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
21615,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
21616,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
21617,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
21618,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: And here I am ready to train.
21619,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: Why down here?
21620,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
21621,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
21622,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn: Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
21623,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
21624,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: I'll leave you to it.
21625,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
21626,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
21627,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: remains silent and stares at TYRION.
21628,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
21629,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: Don't talk about our father.
21630,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Listen to me --
21631,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
21632,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
21633,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
21634,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: shakes his head and says nothing.
21635,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,"tyrion: He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
21636,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: What do you want?
21637,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
21638,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime,jaime: You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
21639,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion,tyrion: I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
21640,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I wasn't sure I'd find you.
21641,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I thought you might still be rowing.
21642,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
21643,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
21644,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
21645,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
21646,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
21647,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Anybody give you any trouble?
21648,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
21649,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
21650,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: nods.
21651,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
21652,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I think you need to understand --
21653,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: I'm ready. Let's go.
21654,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: You should know what you're heading into.
21655,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
21656,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
21657,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry: I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
21658,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: You might want to bring one of those swords.
21659,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
21660,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,"gendry: I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
21661,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
21662,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: this I know.
21663,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
21664,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
21665,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
21666,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
21667,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: Who should I say I am?
21668,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.

21674,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
21675,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: The docks are that way.
21676,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
21677,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Still five gold dragons?
21678,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Are you joking?

21684,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: turns and begins walking back to his boat.
21685,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: What's in the boat?
21686,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: pauses and turns back to the guards.
21687,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Not more gold.
21688,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Wine?
21689,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Mmm.
21690,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: I like wine.

21846,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: You really want to go out there again?
21847,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: You're not the only ones.
21848,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
21849,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
21850,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,sandor: pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
21851,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: They want to go beyond the Wall too.
21852,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,"beric: We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming."
21853,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
21854,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
21855,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: Thoros?
21856,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: sits up from a dark corner.
21857,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: I hardly recognized you.
21858,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: Ser Jorah Mormont --
21859,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
21860,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
21861,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
21862,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: He was my father.
21863,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: He hunted us like animals.
21864,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,"jorah: You returned the favor, as I recall."
21865,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
21866,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Our reasons aren't your reasons.
21867,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
21868,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
21869,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
21870,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,"sandor: For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
21871,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah,jorah: Don't you want to know what we're doing?
21872,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
21873,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: He's right. We're all on the same side.
21874,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry,gendry: How can we be?
21875,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon,jon: We're all breathing.
21876,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.
21877,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,end,end: CREDITS
21878,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Are you all right?
21879,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: faces JON and grunts.
21880,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Ever been north before?
21881,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: Never seen snow before.
21882,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
21883,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: You've never been down south.
21884,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I've been to Winterfell.
21885,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: That's the north.
21886,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
21887,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
21888,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
21889,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
21890,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: We have to make due with what we've got.
21891,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
21892,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: This one is maybe not so smart.
21893,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Davos says he is a strong fighter.
21894,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Good. That's more important than being smart.
21895,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: looks at JON as they continue to walk.
21896,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
21897,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
21898,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
21899,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros: Are you still mad at us, boy?"
21900,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: You sold me to a witch.
21901,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros: Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
21902,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
21903,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,"gendry: I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
21904,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Sounds all right so far.
21905,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: and put leeches on me.
21906,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Was she naked too?
21907,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: She needed your blood.
21908,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: Yes. Thank you. I know that.
21909,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
21910,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: It could have been worse.
21911,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
21912,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"sandor: But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
21913,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry,gendry: I'm not whinging.
21914,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
21915,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: motions to BERIC.
21916,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
21917,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
21918,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: Good lad.
21919,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
21920,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
21921,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
21922,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah: I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
21923,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
21924,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: Your father wanted to execute me.
21925,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I heard.
21926,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
21927,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: and JON glance at each other.
21928,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I'm glad he didn't capture you.
21929,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: Me too.
21930,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
21931,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,"jon: Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
21932,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
21933,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
21934,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
21935,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
21936,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah: pauses, then nods at JON."
21937,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: He gave it to you.
21938,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I'm not his son.
21939,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,"jorah: pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
21940,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
21941,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
21942,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah,jorah: I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
21943,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
21944,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: I remember.
21945,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
21946,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: starts a slow clap.
21947,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
21948,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: turns to look at ARYA.
21949,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: What?
21950,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
21951,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
21952,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: You don't have to read it. I remember.
21953,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
21954,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: They forced me to do it.
21955,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
21956,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
21957,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
21958,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: They told me it was the only way to save father.
21959,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
21960,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: You were there?
21961,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
21962,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
21963,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I wanted to.
21964,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: But you didn't. Just like me.
21965,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
21966,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa: You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
21967,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I was training.
21968,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa: Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
21969,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
21970,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: You never would have survived what I survived.
21971,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I guess we'll never know.
21972,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: What are you doing to do with that letter.
21973,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: I don't know yet.
21974,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
21975,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."

21977,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
21978,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,"sansa: Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
21979,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,"arya: The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
21980,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa,sansa: You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
21981,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya,arya: Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.

21985,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
21986,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
21987,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: looks up at TORMUND.
21988,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Gingers I hate.
21989,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
21990,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
21991,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Don't point your fucking finger at me.
21992,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
21993,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
21994,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: I didn't trip. I was pushed.
21995,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Ever since you've been mean.
21996,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Will you fuck off?
21997,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
21998,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: stops and turns to TORMUND.
21999,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
22000,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Dick?
22001,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Cock.
22002,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Ah. Dick. I like it.
22003,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: I bet you do.
22004,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"sandor: turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
22005,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
22006,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: stops and glances at TORMUND.
22007,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Brienne of Tarth.
22008,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: You know her?
22009,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22010,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22011,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22012,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: nods.
22013,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: You do know her.
22014,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: We've met.
22015,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: and TORMUND begin walking.
22016,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
22017,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22018,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I'm good at killing people.
22019,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: You don't much look like him.
22020,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Who's that?
22021,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
22022,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: You knew him?
22023,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
22024,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I serve the north.
22025,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22026,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
22027,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: He wants you alive.
22028,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Why?
22029,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: I don't know.
22030,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,"jon: That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22031,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22032,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: So what are you fighting for?
22033,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
22034,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: But we all die.
22035,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22036,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
22037,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
22038,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon,jon: Aye. Maybe that's enough.
22039,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
22040,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: That's what I saw in the fire.
22041,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: points towards the mountain.
22042,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: A mountain like an arrowhead.
22043,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: Are you sure?
22044,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: turns to THOROS and nods his head.
22045,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: We're getting close.
22046,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion: is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
22047,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys: Do you know what I like about you?
22048,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion: turns to look at DAENERYS.
22049,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion: I honestly don't.
22050,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys: You're not a hero.
22051,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion: Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
22052,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys: walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
22053,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,tyrion: I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22054,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,"daenerys: I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22055,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,"tyrion: It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22056,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys,daenerys: Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22057,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22058,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Oil?
22059,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: Pitch, my lord."
22060,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: How many barrels?
22061,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: 500, my lord."
22062,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Get 500 more.
22063,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: Yes, my lord."
22064,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22065,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: The thrill will fade.
22066,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22067,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Gold?
22068,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22069,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Family.
22070,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Not without a cock, you don't."
22071,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22072,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Yet, your brother--"
22073,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22074,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22075,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"man: Archers, stand tall!"
22076,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,man: Cover that wall!
22077,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: How many people live here?
22078,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: A million, give or take."
22079,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22080,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22081,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Why isn't she with them?
22082,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22083,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: And the rest of them?
22084,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,qyburn: They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22085,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Including our brother.
22086,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn: Yes, Your Grace."
22087,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
22088,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,missandei,missandei: Why did they build it?
22089,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah,"jorah: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22090,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22091,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: Maybe it still is.
22092,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22093,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22094,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22095,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"podrick: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22096,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Supporting the enemy, no less."
22097,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick: Hard to blame you.
22098,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: Cersei will anyway.
22099,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick: I'm glad you're alive.
22100,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22101,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,soldier: What's in there?
22102,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Fuck off.
22103,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: I thought you were dead.
22104,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Not yet. You came pretty close.
22105,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: I was only trying to protect her.
22106,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: You and me both.
22107,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: She's alive. Arya.
22108,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Where?
22109,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: Winterfell.
22110,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Who's protecting her if you're here?
22111,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22112,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: It won't be me.
22113,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22114,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"podrick: It is, my lord."
22115,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22116,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I'm sure your new queen--
22117,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: You've been thinking about our new queen.
22118,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"varys: And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22119,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22120,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22121,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22122,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: It's good to see you again.
22123,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Yeah, you, too."
22124,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor: Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22125,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22126,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22127,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: You might.
22128,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22129,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22130,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
22131,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Where is she?
22132,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: She'll be here soon.
22133,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Didn't travel with you?
22134,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: No.
22135,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: We've been here for some time.
22136,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: My apologies.
22137,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: We are all facing a unique
22138,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron: Theon! I have your sister
22139,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22140,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22141,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22142,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22143,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22144,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron: Why?
22145,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Sit down or leave.
22146,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22147,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22148,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: We all know that will never happen.
22149,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Then why are we here?
22150,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22151,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22152,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22153,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22154,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: Yes. That's all.
22155,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22156,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22157,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: The word of a would-be usurper.
22158,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22159,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: We can destroy them by burning them.
22160,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22161,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22162,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22163,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: How many?
22164,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: A hundred thousand, at least."
22165,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron: Can they swim?
22166,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: No.
22167,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,euron: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22168,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: What are you talking about?
22169,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22170,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron,"euron: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22171,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22172,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: In return, the King"
22173,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: Just the King
22174,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22175,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22176,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22177,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: Ser Jaime.
22178,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22179,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22180,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22181,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,"brienne: Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22182,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Fuck loyalty?
22183,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22184,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: And tell her what?
22185,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: I wish you hadn't done that.
22186,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22187,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: I know!
22188,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
22189,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
22190,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22191,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22192,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22193,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
22194,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22195,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: I did this. I should go.
22196,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
22197,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: You spoke with her?
22198,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22199,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22200,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22201,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22202,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22203,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22204,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I didn't know about that.
22205,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22206,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Cersei, I didn't know."
22207,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: the destruction of this family.
22208,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22209,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: You killed our father
22210,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22211,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
22212,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I have never been more sorry about anything.
22213,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: I will not hear it, not from you."
22214,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: I will not hear it!
22215,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22216,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
22217,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22218,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: I will not
22219,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22220,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22221,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22222,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22223,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22224,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22225,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,"tyrion: Mm, not like this."
22226,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22227,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: Yes.
22228,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Why?
22229,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22230,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22231,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22232,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22233,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22234,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion,tyrion: You're pregnant.
22235,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: No one is less happy about this than I am.
22236,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22237,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22238,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22239,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: I can't have children.
22240,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: Who told you that?
22241,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: The witch who murdered my husband.
22242,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22243,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22244,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon: So, what now?"
22245,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22246,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22247,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22248,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22249,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22250,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22251,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22252,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22253,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: What does that have to do with anything?
22254,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22255,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: You think he wants to marry her?
22256,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,"petyr: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22257,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22258,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,"petyr: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22259,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22260,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,"petyr: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22261,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22262,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: She's your sister
22263,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22264,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: Why did she come to Winterfell?
22265,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22266,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,petyr: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22267,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22268,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr,"petyr: And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22269,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: Lady
22270,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon: If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22271,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,"daenerys: And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22272,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah,"jorah: Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22273,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,"jon: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22274,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys,daenerys: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22275,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon,theon: Jon.
22276,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon,theon: Can I speak with you?
22277,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon,jon: All right.
22278,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon,"theon: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."

22302,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"harrag: So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22303,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon,theon: We're done with all that.
22304,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,harrag: Who says we are?

What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."

22363,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,"cersei: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
22364,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"

22373,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
22374,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.

22383,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
22384,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,"jaime: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."

22387,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
22388,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
22389,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: And that will be treason.
22390,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime,jaime: Treason?
22391,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei,cersei: Disobeying your queen

22426,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: Are you all right?
22427,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
22428,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: You did the right thing.
22429,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: You did it.
22430,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
22431,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: Does that bother you?
22432,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
22433,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
22434,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
22435,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
22436,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,"arya: In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
22437,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,sansa: Father
22438,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya,arya: I miss him.
22439,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa,"sansa: Me, too."
22440,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,beric,beric: It's a long way down.
22441,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tormund,tormund: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

22444,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tormund,tormund: Come on! Run! Run!
22445,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
22446,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"varys: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
22447,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: Because I have balls, and you don't."
22448,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
22449,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Look at you.
22450,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: You're a man.
22451,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran,bran: Almost.
22452,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Where's Arya?
22453,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: Lurking somewhere.
22454,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,"jon: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
22455,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,"daenerys: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."

22457,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran,bran: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
22458,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran,"bran: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
22459,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,"sansa: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
22460,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,"umber: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
22461,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,umber: And my lord.
22462,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,umber: And my queen. Sorry.
22463,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
22464,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
22465,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,maester,"maester: At once, Your Grace."
22466,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: Your Grace.
22467,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.
22468,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: A lord? Nothing at all?
22469,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: It's not important.
22470,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: Not important? We named you King in the North.
22471,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,man: King of the North!
22472,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,"jon: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
22473,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
22474,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
22475,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,"sansa: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
22476,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: Whatever they want.

22484,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
22485,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,"sansa: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
22486,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
22487,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: It had its moments.
22488,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: Apologies for leaving like that.
22489,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."

22491,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
22492,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,"tyrion: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
22493,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
22494,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: She did.
22495,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: And you believed her?
22496,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
22497,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa,sansa: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
22498,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: You used to be taller.
22499,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: How did you sneak up on me?
22500,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: How did you survive a knife through the heart?
22501,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: I didn't.
22502,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: You still have it.
22503,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: Needle.
22504,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Have you ever used it?
22505,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: Once or twice.
22506,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: Valyrian steel.
22507,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Jealous?
22508,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: Too heavy for me.
22509,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
22510,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,"arya: She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
22511,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
22512,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: She's the smartest person I've ever met.
22513,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Now you're defending her?
22514,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: You?
22515,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: I'm defending our family. So is she.
22516,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: Yeah. I'm her family too.
22517,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya,arya: Don't forget that.
22518,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
22519,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Good.
22520,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
22521,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
22522,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
22523,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
22524,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara: Are we in King's Landing?
22525,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Mm.
22526,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara: You picked the losing side.
22527,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
22528,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
22529,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
22530,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
22531,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
22532,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: Horses?
22533,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,harry: Two thousand.
22534,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: And elephants?
22535,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
22536,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
22537,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
22538,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
22539,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
22540,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Am I most welcome here?
22541,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
22542,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
22543,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: I was hoping we could talk in private.
22544,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: After the war. That was our agreement.
22545,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Wars sometimes last years.
22546,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
22547,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: How?
22548,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,"euron: I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
22549,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
22550,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: They were lesser men.
22551,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
22552,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
22553,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,"dirah: Archie, was it?"
22554,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: And William.
22555,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: Tall handsome William?
22556,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,"crayah: Yeah, tall handsome William."
22557,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
22558,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
22559,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: Did you?
22560,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: Nearly killed it.
22561,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,marei,marei: That's brave.
22562,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: That boy Eddie.
22563,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: The ginger?
22564,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
22565,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: How does he sleep with no eyelids?
22566,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
22567,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
22568,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: You're kidding me.
22569,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
22570,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
22571,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
22572,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
22573,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: Which girl?
22574,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
22575,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
22576,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
22577,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
22578,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
22579,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: Yeah, well, good luck with that."
22580,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
22581,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
22582,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: That fucking family.
22583,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
22584,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: I wanted those elephants.
22585,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,"euron: So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
22586,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You're insulting my late husband?
22587,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Are you offended?
22588,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,"cersei: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
22589,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: And the Kingslayer?

22593,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: Do I please the queen?
22594,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
22595,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei,cersei: But now I want to be alone.
22596,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron,euron: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

22599,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon: Daenerys went north.
22600,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
22601,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon: You're my queen. I go where you command.
22602,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara,yara: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
22603,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon,theon: What is dead may never die.

22608,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,davos: Can't argue with that.
22609,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
22610,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: And our queen is grateful.
22611,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
22612,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
22613,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"

22615,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
22616,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: I'm not that old.
22617,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Not as old as him.
22618,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
22619,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"varys: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
22620,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion,tyrion: What is that?
22621,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys: Nothing lasts.
22622,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: Your sister doesn't like me.

22629,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: What's wrong with them?
22630,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: They don't like the North.
22631,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: Go on.

22638,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: You've completely ruined horses for me.
22639,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: We could stay a thousand years-
22640,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: No one would find us.
22641,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: We'd be pretty old.
22642,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon,jon: It's cold up here for a southern girl.
22643,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys,daenerys: So keep your queen warm.

22652,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,sandor: I heard you were here. You left me to die.

22757,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
22758,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
22759,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
22760,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: We""?"
22761,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
22762,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion: Your Grace, I know my brother-"
22763,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Like you knew your sister?
22764,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion: He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
22765,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
22766,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa: You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
22767,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
22768,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: The things we do for love.
22769,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
22770,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Because this goes beyond loyalty.
22771,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: This is about survival.
22772,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: You don't know me well, Your Grace."
22773,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
22774,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
22775,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: You vouch for him?
22776,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: I do.
22777,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: You would fight beside him?
22778,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: I would.
22779,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa: I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
22780,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: What does the Warden of the North say about it?
22781,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon,jon: We need every man we can get.
22782,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Very well.
22783,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: Thank you, Your Grace."
22784,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
22785,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: I was a fool.
22786,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Not for the first time.
22787,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
22788,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
22789,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: Don't you have something better to do?
22790,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: You make my weapon yet?
22791,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
22792,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
22793,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: It's strong enough.
22794,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry: It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
22795,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: Are you going to be down in the crypt?
22796,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry: No, but-"
22797,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: But you're a fighter.
22798,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: I've done my share.
22799,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: You've fought them?
22800,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: I did. Some of them.
22801,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: How many?
22802,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: A few. That was enough.
22803,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: What are they like?
22804,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: Bad. Really bad.
22805,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,"arya: Really bad""?"
22806,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,"arya: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
22807,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,"gendry: Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
22808,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: I know Death.
22809,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: He's got many faces.
22810,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: I look forward to seeing this one.
22811,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya,arya: My weapon?
22812,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry,gendry: I'll get right on it.
22813,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: I'm sorry for what I did to you.
22814,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
22815,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: I'm not that person anymore.
22816,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,"bran: You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
22817,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: You're not?
22818,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: No. I'm something else now.
22819,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: You're not angry at me.
22820,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: I'm not angry at anyone.
22821,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Why didn't you tell them?
22822,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
22823,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: What about afterwards?
22824,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran,bran: How do you know there is an afterwards?
22825,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, here we are."
22826,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: Yes, here we are."
22827,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: Together again.
22828,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: And the masses rejoice.
22829,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: How do they feel about their new queen?
22830,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: She's your new queen too.
22831,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
22832,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: And she is? Different?
22833,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: She is.
22834,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: You're sure about her?
22835,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: I am.
22836,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: She didn't seem sure about you.
22837,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
22838,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Hmm.
22839,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
22840,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: Was she lying about the baby too?
22841,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: No, that part is real."
22842,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
22843,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: What?
22844,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
22845,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,"tyrion: So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
22846,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,both,both: A girl's mouth around-
22847,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Your cock.
22848,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: My cock.
22849,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
22850,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion,tyrion: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
22851,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: Ser Jaime.
22852,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Lady Brienne.
22853,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: He's come a long way.
22854,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
22855,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
22856,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
22857,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: It is.
22858,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: The rise, it should give us some advantage."
22859,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"brienne: If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
22860,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: Yes, I think you're right."
22861,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: What are you doing?
22862,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: I think you know.
22863,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: I truly don't.
22864,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
22865,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: You want me to insult you?
22866,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: No!
22867,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,jaime: Good.
22868,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime,"jaime: I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
22869,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,brienne: I better get back.
22870,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah: Forgive me, khaleesi."
22871,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Have you done something to offend me?
22872,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah: Many things.
22873,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Long ago and long forgiven.
22874,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
22875,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
22876,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah: You made the right choice.
22877,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
22878,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
22879,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah: But the mind behind all those words-
22880,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
22881,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,jorah: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
22882,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
22883,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah,"jorah: I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
22884,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,royce,"royce: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
22885,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
22886,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
22887,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
22888,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,"sansa: Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
22889,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
22890,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
22891,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
22892,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
22893,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: You never should have either.
22894,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: I thought he knew his sister.
22895,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: Families are complicated.
22896,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: Ours certainly have been.
22897,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: A sad thing to have in common.
22898,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
22899,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."

22901,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,daenerys: That bothers you.
22902,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
22903,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys,"daenerys: All my life, I've known one goal"
22904,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa,sansa: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.

23348,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,"davos: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"

23356,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion,tyrion: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

23386,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon: What do you want?
23387,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,varys: All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
23388,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon: I don't want it. I never have.
23389,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"varys: I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"

23392,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: There's something you need to know.

23398,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: He does.
23399,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys: Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
23400,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
23401,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: And Varys?
23402,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
23403,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
23404,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: It was a mistake.
23405,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
23406,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: She trusts me.
23407,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys: Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."

23415,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
23416,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys: It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
23417,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: What did I say would happen if you told your sister?

23419,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
23420,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon,jon: I love you. And you will always be my queen.

23425,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
23426,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
23427,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
23428,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
23429,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
23430,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: I beg you, my queen-"
23431,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
23432,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,"daenerys: Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."

23435,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
23436,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys,daenerys: It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.

23448,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,soldier: Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?

23460,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.

23463,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,unsullied: No.
23464,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
23465,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: How did they find you?
23466,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: Did you consider taking it off?
23467,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime: Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
23468,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: And you're going back to her, to die with her."
23469,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: You've underestimated her before.
23470,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
23471,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: Difficult to do from here.
23472,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
23473,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
23474,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime: To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
23475,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
23476,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime: The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
23477,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
23478,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
23479,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: The city will fall tomorrow.
23480,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime: She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
23481,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
23482,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,"jaime: Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
23483,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,tyrion: Why?
23484,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
23485,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
23486,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."

23488,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: You have my word.
23489,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
23490,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: I'll try.
23491,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
23492,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime,jaime: Your queen will execute you for this.
23493,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
23494,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion,"tyrion: Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."

I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
23708,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: So is there life after death?
23709,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: Not that I've seen.
23710,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.

23712,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."

23716,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
23717,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
23718,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."

23720,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: Cersei left her no choice.
23721,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
23722,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
23723,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: And she burned down a city for it.
23724,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
23725,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: Would you have done it?
23726,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: What?
23727,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
23728,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: I don't know.
23729,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
23730,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: What's it matter what I'd do?
23731,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
23732,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
23733,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
23734,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: Love is the death of duty.
23735,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: You just came up with that?
23736,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
23737,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
23738,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
23739,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: That's her decision. She is the queen.
23740,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: I'm sorry it came to this.
23741,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
23742,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
23743,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
23744,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: She doesn't get to choose.
23745,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
23746,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
23747,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
23748,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: It was necessary.
23749,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
23750,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
23751,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: And Tyrion?
23752,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"

23754,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: I can't.
23755,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
23756,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,"jon: Please, Dany."
23757,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
23758,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
23759,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
23760,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
23761,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: Because I know what is good. And so do you.
23762,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: I don't.
23763,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: You do. You do. You've always known.
23764,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon,jon: What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
23765,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,daenerys: They don't get to choose.
23766,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys,"daenerys: Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."

23769,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey: He is our prisoner.
23770,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa: So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
23771,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey: We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
23772,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,"sansa: If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
23773,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey: And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
23774,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara,yara: Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
23775,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa: You swore to follow a tyrant.
23776,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara,"yara: She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."

This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
23780,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey: We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
23781,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: It's not for you to decide.
23782,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey,grey: You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
23783,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
23784,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester,maester: We don't have a king or queen.
23785,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.

23800,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
23801,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa,sansa: Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.

23866,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."

23879,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn: The farther away, the better."

23881,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: As you wish, Your Grace."

23892,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
23893,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn: Indeed we can.
23894,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
23895,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,davos: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
23896,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."

23898,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn: You Master of Grammar now too?
23899,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,"tyrion: Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."

23901,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn: The strong live and the weak don't.
23902,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: Find the best builders and set them to the task.
23903,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
23904,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,sam: Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
23905,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
23906,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,brienne: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
23907,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
23908,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion,tyrion: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
