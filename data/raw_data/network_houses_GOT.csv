100,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,stark,"stark: In any case, candles."
101,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,snow,snow: Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
102,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,greyjoy,"greyjoy: It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"

105,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,stark,"stark: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
106,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,stark,"stark: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"

359,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.

The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."

379,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."

393,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,snow,"snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."

395,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,snow,snow: You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
396,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I think so.
397,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,snow,snow: First lesson

430,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
431,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Nor will I.
432,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."

434,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."

436,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
437,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: She's little more than a child.
438,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
439,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Tell me we're not speaking of this.
440,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
441,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
442,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."

448,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.

453,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,snow,snow: Until your brother killed that King.
454,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"

474,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Have you ever seen a dragon?
475,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,"irri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
476,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Everywhere? Even in the east?
477,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
478,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jhiqui,jhiqui: It is known.
479,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
480,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: The moon?
481,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
482,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
483,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
484,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
485,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: How old were you?
486,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
487,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Nine?!
488,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
489,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
490,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: Yes.
491,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Will it take three years?
492,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: No.
493,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Welcome.
494,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
495,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,luwin,luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.
496,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
497,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?"
498,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
499,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cassel,"cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
500,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
501,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,greyjoy,"greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
502,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,luwin,"luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
503,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
504,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I'll ride to King's Landing.
505,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
506,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: Mother, you can't."
507,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I must.
508,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cassel,cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
509,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
510,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cassel,cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
511,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: What about Bran?
512,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
513,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
514,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: Finish a man?
515,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
516,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,"targaryen: Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
517,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
518,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
519,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
520,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,targaryen,targaryen: No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
521,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: Pardon me, Ser."
522,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,clegane,"clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
523,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
524,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,clegane,clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
525,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
526,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
527,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
528,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,mycah: I'll get you!
529,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Arya!
530,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
531,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
532,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"mycah: Mycah, my Lord."
533,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: He the butcher's boy.
534,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: He's my friend.
535,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
536,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"mycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
537,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
538,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"mycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
539,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
540,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Stop it!
541,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: Arya, stay out of this."
542,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
543,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
544,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,"lannister: I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
545,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Nymeria!
546,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Please don't.
547,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,"stark: Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."

549,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
550,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
551,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier: It's a direwolf.
552,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,soldier: I'll check down here.

566,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,"baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: That's not what happened!
573,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: Liar!
575,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,lannister,lannister: Shut up!

596,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: You can't mean it.
597,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,baratheon,baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.

607,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,stark,stark: The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.

616,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
617,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.

620,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."

622,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
623,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
624,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"

629,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
630,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,"baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
631,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
632,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
633,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
634,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
635,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
636,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,"pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
637,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Grand Maester.
638,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
639,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: And you served another King.
640,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,"pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
641,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Without the King?
642,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,"baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
643,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
644,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: We are the lords of small matters here.
645,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
646,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: Mmm, how much?"
647,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
648,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?
649,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
650,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
651,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
652,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: How could you let this happen?
653,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
654,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
655,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,"pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
656,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,"baratheon: Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
657,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
658,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
659,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
660,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
661,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Please, it's nearly healed."
662,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: It's ugly.
663,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
664,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
665,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
666,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Do I have to marry her?
667,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
668,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I don't want to.
669,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
670,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
671,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: How would you handle them?
672,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
673,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: A royal army?
674,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
675,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: And if the northerners rebel?
676,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
677,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
678,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: For me. I'm their King.
679,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
680,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I'm not asking.
681,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
682,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
683,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
684,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mordane,"mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
685,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I'm practicing.
686,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Practicing for what?
687,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: The Prince.
688,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mordane,"mordane: Arya, stop!"
689,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
690,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: The Hound killed your friend.
691,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
692,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: You're an idiot.
693,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
694,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mordane,mordane: Enough!
695,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: What's happening here?
696,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mordane,mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
697,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
698,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
699,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
700,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mordane,mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.
701,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: It's all right. Go on.
702,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: War was easier than daughters.
703,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Go away!
704,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
705,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Mine.
706,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
707,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
708,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Come here. Now what do you want with this?
709,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: It's called Needle.
710,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
711,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
712,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: laughs] That's the essence of it.
713,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
714,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
715,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
716,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
717,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: So was I! He is a liar.
718,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
719,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
720,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
721,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Winter is coming.
722,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
723,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
724,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
725,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I can keep it?
726,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
727,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,nan,nan: Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
728,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I hate your stories.
729,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,nan,nan: I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
730,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
731,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,nan,"nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
732,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: What are you telling him now?
733,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,nan,nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
734,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
735,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Maybe we do.
736,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
737,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
738,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Don't ever say that.
739,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I'd rather be dead.
740,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cassel,"cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
741,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
742,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cassel,cassel: My Lady.
743,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
744,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I would. We've done nothing wrong.
745,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
746,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
747,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"guard: Follow me, Lady Stark."
748,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
749,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
750,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
751,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
752,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
753,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
754,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: A dear friend told me.
755,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: Lady Stark.
756,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Lord Varys.
757,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
758,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: How did you know I was coming?
759,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"varys: Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
760,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Do you know whose dagger this is?
761,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,varys: I must admit I do not.
762,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
763,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Yours?
764,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
765,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: To whom?
766,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
767,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,thorne,"thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
768,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,thorne,thorne: Next!
769,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,thorne,"thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
770,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: A charming man.
771,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Good news or bad?
775,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Both.
776,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pycelle,pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: My wife is in Winterfell.
779,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: Is she?
780,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
781,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
782,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Ned! [poking her head out of a window]

784,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!"
785,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: It's an improvement.
786,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?"
789,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,rast: What do you care about our faces?
791,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: We have proof. We have the blade.
799,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,"baelish: I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baelish,baelish: Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: How could you be so stupid?
805,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Calm down.
806,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Then what are you raving about?
810,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: And my husband?
813,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
814,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Let me go.
815,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Never.
816,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
817,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I wish I could see the girls.
818,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: It's too dangerous.
819,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Just for a moment.
820,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Until we know who our enemies are...
821,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
822,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
823,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: And if you find the proof?
824,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
825,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
826,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: He still loves you.
827,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Does he?
828,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Off with you.
829,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
830,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,selmy,"selmy: Of course, your Grace."
831,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: Who was it?
832,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,selmy,selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
833,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: How'd you do it?
834,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,selmy,selmy: Lance through the heart.
835,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,"baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
836,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: It's empty, your Grace."
837,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?
838,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: There's no more wine.
839,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,"baratheon: Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
840,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
841,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,selmy,"selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
842,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
843,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,selmy,"selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
844,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?
845,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I cut his head off, so no."
846,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,baratheon,baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
847,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
848,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
849,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: From whom?
850,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,"mormont: If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
851,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: Tell them all to stop.
852,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
853,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: Until I command them otherwise.
854,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: You're learning to talk like a Queen.
855,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
856,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
857,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
858,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: No!
859,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
860,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,"targaryen: Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
861,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
862,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,"mormont: Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
863,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]
864,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
865,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: You're leaving?
866,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
867,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: What kind of reports?
868,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: The kind I don't want to believe.
869,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: m ready. I won't let you down.
870,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
871,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: But I'm better than every...
872,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
873,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: A bear's balls.
874,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: You're joking?
875,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
876,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?
877,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
878,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
879,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
880,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
881,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
882,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
883,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
884,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
885,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: Call me what you like.
886,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
887,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
888,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
889,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
890,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
891,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,"stark: Enjoy the capital, brother."
892,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: I always do.
893,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
894,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
895,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
896,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
897,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
898,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
899,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
900,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Yes, Khaleesi."
901,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: What are you doing?
902,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
903,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,"mormont: For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
904,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
905,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Armor.
906,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
907,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Slow.
908,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: Slow.
909,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,"mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
910,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
911,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
912,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
913,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
914,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
915,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,rakharo: There are no rabbits.
916,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks."

918,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
919,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
920,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.

923,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
924,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
925,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
926,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.

931,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,aemon,aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
932,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,"mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
933,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
934,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
935,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,aemon,aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
936,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,mormont,mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.

938,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: It's a boy.
939,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,drogo,drogo: How do you know?
940,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,targaryen,targaryen: I know.
941,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,"snow: I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
942,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
943,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
944,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
945,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,"snow: If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
946,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,lannister: Of course.
947,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,snow,snow: He'll never walk again.
948,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lannister,"lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."

952,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
953,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
954,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: It's too heavy.
955,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,forel: It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
956,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: What if I drop it?
957,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
958,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: I'm a girl.
959,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
960,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,stark,stark: A needle.
961,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
962,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,forel,"forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."

967,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: I don't want to go.
968,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",greyjoy,"greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
969,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
970,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
971,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
972,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,"stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."

974,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?

976,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: Curious.
977,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: Why are you here?
978,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
979,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,"stark: Kneel, Hodor."
980,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: Do you like to ride, Bran?"

982,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",luwin,luwin: The boy has lost the use of his legs.
983,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
984,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: I'm not a cripple.
985,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
986,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: Will I really be able to ride?
987,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
988,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

999,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1000,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",greyjoy,greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.
1001,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."

1003,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,"lannister: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."

1067,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?

1143,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pycelle,pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1144,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1145,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pycelle,"pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"

1160,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1161,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?

1210,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",stark,stark: What kind of questions?
1211,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",baratheon,"baratheon: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."

1232,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",lannister,lannister: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?

1257,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1258,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: What's this?
1259,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1260,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1261,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: Please.
1262,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: This stinks of manure. All of it.

1266,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: You do not talk back to me!
1267,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1268,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1269,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1270,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: I wouldn't doubt it.
1271,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1272,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: Sally on the side?
1273,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,"tarly: It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1274,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1275,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1276,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,"snow: As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1277,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: I find that hard to believe.
1278,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,"snow: I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1279,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: You didn't know where to put it?
1280,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: I know where to put it.
1281,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Was she... Old and ugly?
1282,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1283,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: What color hair?
1284,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: Red.
1285,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: I like red hair. And her... Her...
1286,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: You don't want to know.
1287,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: That good?
1288,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: Better.
1289,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1290,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: What's my name?
1291,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Jon Snow?
1292,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: And why is my surname Snow?
1293,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1294,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,"snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1295,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: So... You didn't know where to put it?
1296,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",thorne,"thorne: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1297,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tarly,tarly: It is a bit nippy.
1298,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",thorne,"thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1299,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",snow,snow: I build my own fires.
1300,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",thorne,"thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1301,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1302,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",mormont,mormont: Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.

1304,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",mormont,mormont: The truth now
1305,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1306,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",mormont,"mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."

1308,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",mormont,mormont: Home.
1309,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",targaryen,targaryen: I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.

1322,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",baelish,baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.

Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."

And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?

1493,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: You need legs to work a bow.
1494,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,luwin,"luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1495,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Really?
1496,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,luwin,luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1497,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1498,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1499,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.
1500,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1501,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1502,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Jealous?
1503,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?
1504,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1505,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Might surprise you.
1506,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Hmm?
1507,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1508,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1509,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: You are jealous.
1510,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1511,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: And what about the Starks?
1512,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
1513,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
1514,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1515,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: You're a very serious boy.
1516,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm not a boy.
1517,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1518,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,greyjoy,greyjoy: I don't want to pay for it.
1519,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,ros: Then get yourself a wife.
1520,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1521,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: How is your son, my Lord?"
1522,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: He'll never walk again.
1523,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: But his mind is sound?
1524,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: So they say.
1525,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1526,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1527,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1528,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: I didn't trust you.
1529,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: So why do you trust me now?
1530,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1531,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: What sort of doom does the King face?
1532,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1533,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Who gave it to him?
1534,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1535,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1536,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1537,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1538,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Someone who could afford it.
1539,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1540,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: He started asking questions.
1541,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1542,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mopatis,"mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1543,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1544,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mopatis,"mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1545,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: This Hand is not the other.
1546,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mopatis,mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1547,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1548,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mopatis,mopatis: It never was.
1549,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1550,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: You do move quietly.
1551,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: We all have our qualities.
1552,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1553,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1554,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1555,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1556,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1557,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1558,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1559,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1560,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1561,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Strictly speaking.
1562,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1563,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1564,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1565,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1566,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?
1567,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Eyes I own.
1568,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1569,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1570,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: One shudders at the thought.
1571,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Oh.
1572,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1573,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Have you?
1574,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1575,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Was that you under the bed?
1576,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,"baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1577,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"varys: Oh, please."
1578,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1579,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,"baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1580,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baelish,baelish: To a small council meeting?
1581,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1582,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard: Off with you. No begging.
1583,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1584,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,guard: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1585,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I want to see my father.
1586,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1587,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"guard: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1588,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1589,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1590,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: They said they were going to kill you.
1591,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Who did?
1592,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1593,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: Oh, Arya."
1594,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1595,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Where did you hear this?
1596,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1597,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?
1598,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Chasing a cat.
1599,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cassel,"cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1600,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: Your name, friend?"
1601,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1602,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I'm a girl!
1603,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Did Benjen send you?
1604,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1605,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1606,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1607,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Know what?
1608,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: Best said in private, my Lord."
1609,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.
1610,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: Jory, take her safely to her room."
1611,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cassel,"cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1612,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: How many guards does my father have?
1613,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cassel,cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1614,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,"stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1615,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cassel,"cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady."
1616,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Well?
1617,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1618,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,egen,"egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1619,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: To whom do I speak?
1620,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,egen,"egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1621,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: There was no time to send word.
1622,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,egen,"egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1623,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1624,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,egen,egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1625,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.
1626,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,egen,"egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1627,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lannister,lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1628,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1629,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lannister,lannister: I like you.
1630,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1631,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: I need to see the King first -- alone.
1632,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1633,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: Is it about my wife?
1634,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1635,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,baratheon: The whore is pregnant.
1636,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,stark,stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.
1637,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,"baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."

1704,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,baratheon: His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1705,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrell,tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.

1717,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrell,tyrell: But a lot more than you.
1718,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,"baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."

1720,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.

1722,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,baratheon: Be serious.

1738,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lannister,lannister: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1739,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,"baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."

We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."

1746,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lannister,lannister: Five.
1747,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,"baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."

I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1759,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,baratheon,baratheon: So why now?

I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."

I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"

Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1979,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,baratheon,"baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
1980,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,baratheon,baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”

2561,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2562,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"varys: l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2563,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2564,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"varys: Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2565,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.

2567,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2568,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2569,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,umber,umber: Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2570,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2571,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greyjoy,greyjoy: Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2572,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,umber,umber: Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2573,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."

2575,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,umber,umber: Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2576,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greyjoy,greyjoy: Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2577,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."

2594,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,"frey: Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."

2596,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,frey: Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2597,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: l'm sure there were reasons –
2598,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,frey: l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2599,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2600,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,frey: Why should l let him?
2601,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2602,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,"frey: There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2603,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: You swore an oath to my father.
2604,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,"frey: Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2605,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: Why don't you?
2606,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,frey,"frey: Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"

2608,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,mormont: When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2609,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,"snow: Soon, he says."
2610,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,"mormont: Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2611,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,snow: This is Valyrian steel.
2612,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,"mormont: lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."

2614,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,"mormont: Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2615,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,"snow: Yes, my lord."
2616,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,"mormont: Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2617,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,snow: l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2618,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mormont,"mormont: No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."

2635,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tarly,tarly: There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2636,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,snow: What? What about him?
2637,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tarly,"tarly: He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."

2645,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2646,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,"stark: Fine, fine. And?"
2647,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark,stark: And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.

2659,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,snow,snow: No.
2660,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,aemon,"aemon: So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"

And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."

2788,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Not if you win.

2796,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: But my mother hit harder.
2797,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: You killed your first man before you were 12.
2798,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2799,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: You've been north of the Wall.
2800,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: What brought you up there?
2801,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Work.

2809,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2810,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2811,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2812,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: Are you sure –
2813,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae: Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."

2818,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: That's not how the game works.
2819,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: l don't care the way the game works.
2820,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: Our lord here used to be married.
2821,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Married?
2822,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: How did you hear that?
2823,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2824,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: Another night, perhaps."
2825,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: Not another night. This night.
2826,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: lt's not a pleasant story.
2827,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"shae: Oh, maybe l will cry."
2828,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2829,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2830,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: For three chickens, l should hope so."
2831,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2832,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"bronn: Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2833,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2834,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2835,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You should have known she was a whore.
2836,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2837,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2838,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,"lannister: As l said, l was young and stupid."
2839,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,shae: You are still young and stupid.
2840,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister,lannister: What is it? What do you want?
2841,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,bronn: You're sleeping through the war.

3601,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"yoren: Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3602,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"yoren: It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3603,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,yoren: We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

3617,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"varys: I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."

3627,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lannister,"lannister: You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."

3638,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,baelish,baelish: That's why they're called wildlings.
3639,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,varys: Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

3649,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lannister,"lannister: I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."

Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. .

They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."

3964,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,melisandre: Because it is true. You're troubled my king.

4053,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,stark,stark: Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.

While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."

4087,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,balon: We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4088,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,greyjoy,"greyjoy: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"

4156,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,lannister,"lannister: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."

4173,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,baelish,"baelish: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"

4281,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,lannister,"lannister: He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4282,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4283,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,lannister,lannister: I've decided I don't like riddles.
4284,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"varys: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."

I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"

4493,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baelish,"baelish: Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
4494,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stark,stark: I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
4495,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stark,stark: Good faith?
4496,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stark,stark: What's this?

4502,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,pie,pie: He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.

4528,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
4529,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: My own.
4530,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"

4534,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."

4537,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: That's twice I've warned you.
4538,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stark,"stark: Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
4539,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,"baratheon: It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
4540,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stark,stark: We share a common enemy.
4541,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4542,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"renly: The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."

Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."

4546,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,renly: No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
4547,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,"baratheon: We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."

4553,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,targaryen: My name is Daenerys-

4556,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,"king: Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
4557,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,targaryen: And what should I call you?
4558,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,"king: Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
4559,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,targaryen: The beauty of Quarth is legendary-

4565,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,targaryen: I am not a liar.
4566,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,"king: Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
4567,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,"targaryen: Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."

4572,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,king: Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
4573,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mormont,"mormont: Khaleesi, please be careful."
4574,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,targaryen,"targaryen: Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."

4579,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,king: The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
4580,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"xaro: Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
4581,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,king,king: Our decision is final.
4582,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,xaro: Very well. I invoke soumai.

4597,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,"baratheon: Smith, my lord."

4641,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4642,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: Fewer.
4643,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Pardon?
4644,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4645,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4646,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,"baratheon: You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4647,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4648,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: Does he listen?
4649,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4650,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4651,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4652,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4653,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4654,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4655,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4656,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,baratheon,baratheon: Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4657,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4658,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4659,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4660,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4661,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4662,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: And which are you?
4663,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4664,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"davos: Well, that must be very nice for you."
4665,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: Do you love your wife?
4666,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: I do.
4667,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: Yet you have known other women.
4668,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Don't talk about my wife.
4669,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4670,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: And you will.
4671,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4672,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4673,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4674,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,melisandre: They can't bar our passage.
4675,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,davos: Gods protect us.
4676,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"melisandre: There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4677,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly: You swear it?
4678,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4679,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4680,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: And the wording of this oath?
4681,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4682,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: And in return for my son's loyalty?
4683,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4684,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"renly: When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4685,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,"stark: Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4686,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly: Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4687,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,renly: Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4688,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: No! No.
4689,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier: Follow me!
4690,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,soldier: You'll die for this.
4691,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,"stark: No, wait, it wasn't her!"
4692,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4693,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man: Inside the king's tent - go
4694,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,man: Now.
4695,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: I won't leave him.
4696,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4697,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"man: Over there, go!"
4698,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,brienne: Not that way.
4699,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: We need to go home. Loras.
4700,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,"baelish: My lord, my lady."
4701,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: Get out.
4702,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,"baelish: Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4703,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: And you want that privilege for yourself.
4704,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,"baelish: You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4705,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: There's no time for this.
4706,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras: Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4707,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4708,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4709,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,baelish: Stannis.
4710,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4711,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: You can't stay here.
4712,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"loras: He would have been a true king, a good king."

4714,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,loras: Revenge.
4715,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,"baelish: I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4716,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4717,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: He was very handsome.
4718,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,"baelish: He was, Your Grace."
4719,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,"tyrell: Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4720,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baelish,baelish: Do you want to be a queen?
4721,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrell,tyrell: No. I want to be the queen.
4722,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Killed? By whom?
4723,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4724,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Really? Who'd have thought?
4725,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4726,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Whomever did it, I say well done."
4727,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4728,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4729,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
4730,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
4731,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: She'll be safer in Dorne.
4732,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
4733,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
4734,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
4735,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
4736,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
4737,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
4738,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
4739,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: It's important that we talk about this.
4740,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
4741,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: It's wildfire.
4742,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
4743,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: No.
4744,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: MThat's a lie right there.
4745,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
4746,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
4747,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: I'm telling you the truth.
4748,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: The smart money would be on more likely.
4749,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: She's making wildfire.
4750,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
4751,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
4752,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: I suppose there's only one way to find out.
4753,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
4754,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: When did she tell you this?
4755,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"lancel: I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
4756,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: Swear to me on what?
4757,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: On my life.
4758,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: But I don't care about your life.
4759,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"lancel: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
4760,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
4761,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
4762,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,lancel: Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.

4764,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: Your Grace.
4765,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: What is it?
4766,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
4767,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,"baratheon: Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
4768,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
4769,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
4770,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I-"
4771,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
4772,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: And I've never known you to hide from the truth.

4774,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: I've come to tell you that what I saw.
4775,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,"baratheon: All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
4776,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
4777,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: I'll hear no more about it.

4780,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,"baratheon: As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."

4785,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: Loyal service means telling hard truths.
4786,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,"baratheon: Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"

4789,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,davos: You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
4790,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
4791,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
4792,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,"baratheon: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."

4799,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
4800,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."

4806,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,lannister: The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
4823,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,"greyjoy: You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."

4827,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
4828,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,greyjoy: You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
4829,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,"greyjoy: That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."

4834,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
4835,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,greyjoy: And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
4836,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: You're not.
4837,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,greyjoy: And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
4838,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,dagmer: They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
4839,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,greyjoy: The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
4840,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"dagmer: The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
4841,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,"greyjoy: No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
4842,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,greyjoy,greyjoy: Take me to my ship.
4843,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"reginald: The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."

4845,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,amory: Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
4846,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
4847,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"reginald: We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."

4857,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lannister,"lannister: A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"

4863,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.

4870,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,hghar,hghar: And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.

4882,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
4883,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,hghar,"hghar: That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."

4888,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: Most of them are true.
4889,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,snow,snow: I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
4890,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
4891,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,snow,snow: So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
4892,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"jeor: Well, possible for the Halfhand."

4896,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"sam: The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."

4902,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,snow,snow: One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.

4915,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,bronn: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
4916,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,haylene: Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.

4918,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,haylene: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.

4920,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"bronn: If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."

'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."

4956,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
4957,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
4958,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
4959,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

4965,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."

4989,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,"stark: He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."

5037,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,qhorin: Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5038,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

5046,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,jeor: Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.

5053,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: And what about what a woman wants?
5054,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5055,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5056,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: Why?
5057,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.

5061,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5062,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5063,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,"targaryen: So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."

I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5067,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: And behind the door?
5068,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: And it can all be mine?
5069,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5070,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: All I have to do?
5071,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,xaro: Is marry me.
5072,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: That was a romantic proposal.
5073,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5074,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"xaro: See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5075,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5076,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5077,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,"mormont: To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5078,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: The usurper is dead.
5079,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,"targaryen: The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5080,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5081,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5082,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,"mormont: Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5083,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,"targaryen: And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
5084,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,"mormont: I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
5085,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
5086,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: I only want-

5088,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: To see you on the Iron Throne.
5089,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: Why?
5090,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,"mormont: You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5091,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,"targaryen: So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
5092,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,"mormont: Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
5093,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,targaryen,targaryen: And how do I get the ship?
5094,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,mormont,mormont: I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.

5099,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: Sideways.
5100,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: Why?
5101,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stark,stark: Smaller target.
5102,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,baratheon,baratheon: Am I fighting someone?

5193,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."

5195,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,qhorin: I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5196,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,snow,snow: We could do the same.
5197,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"qhorin: No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."

We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."

But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"

I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
5364,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"xaro: Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
5365,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
5366,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,"targaryen: Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
5367,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
5368,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
5369,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,king: I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
5370,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
5371,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
5372,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
5373,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,king: Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
5374,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,"targaryen: My father sat there, before he was murdered."
5375,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
5376,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: I didn't come here to argue grammar.
5377,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
5378,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: Not yet.
5379,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,king: You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

5381,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,king: When were you there last?
5382,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: I left when I was a baby.
5383,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: So, in truth, you have no allies."
5384,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
5385,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."

He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
5389,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
5390,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,king,"king: I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
5391,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,"targaryen: I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."

He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"

5513,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,osha: It comes at a price.
5514,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm not killing you. That's your price.
5515,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,osha: I already had that.
5516,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,greyjoy,"greyjoy: What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5517,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ahsa,ahsa: What all free people want. My freedom.
5518,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
5519,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,stark: Ow!
5520,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,shae: Shh. It's not deep.
5521,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,stark: I thought they were going to kill me.
5522,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,"shae: They thought so, too."
5523,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,"stark: He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
5524,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,shae: Of course he did.
5525,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,stark: Why? Why would a stranger-
5526,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,shae: You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5527,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,stark: I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5528,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,shae: Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5529,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,stark,stark: But you're not the wrong people.
5530,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,shae: Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
5531,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,guard: And where are you going?
5532,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,osha: I have something for you from Prince Theon.

5534,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,osha: Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5535,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5536,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"xaro: When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
5537,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"xaro: Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
5538,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,targaryen,targaryen: Where are they? Where are my dragons?
5539,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
5540,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lorren,lorren: The giant must have took him.
5541,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
5542,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lorren,"lorren: Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
5543,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,greyjoy: Right. Get the horses and the hounds.

5546,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,greyjoy: Enjoying your first hunt?
5547,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"luwin: So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
5548,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: With hunting, there's blood at the end."
5549,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: They're little boys.
5550,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
5551,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
5552,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,greyjoy: They have no value to me missing.
5553,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,luwin: Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5554,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."

5556,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,greyjoy,"greyjoy: The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
5557,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: We should have took more food.
5558,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
5559,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
5560,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,"stark: And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
5561,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: The boy can't survive on walnuts.
5562,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickon,rickon: I'm fine.
5563,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,osha: We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
5564,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,hodor,hodor: Hodor.
5565,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"osha: Even you, sweet giant."

5568,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,"stark: We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
5569,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rikon,rikon: Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
5570,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"osha: You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
5571,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: They'll be after us with hounds.
5572,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"osha: We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
5573,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
5574,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
5575,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Let's move.
5576,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5577,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5578,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
5579,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Don't call them that.
5580,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: What, stones? Or bone?"
5581,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Neither. Both.
5582,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Move!
5583,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5584,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,"snow: There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5585,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: So the lads just do it with each other?
5586,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: No.
5587,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: Never?
5588,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Never. We swore an oath.
5589,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5590,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Would you please shut up?
5591,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."

5593,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5594,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,"snow: If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5595,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5596,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: It was my choice to say the words.
5597,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: So you don't like girls?
5598,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: Of course I like girls.
5599,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: But you chose never to touch them.
5600,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,snow: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5601,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"ygritte: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5602,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,"snow: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5603,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,ygritte: They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5604,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,snow,"snow: My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."

5608,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountian,mountian: We hanged twenty men last night.
5609,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5610,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,mountain: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5611,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5612,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,"mountain: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5613,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."

5617,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: I'll bring something else.

5619,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: No.
5620,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Of course you are. Eat.
5621,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5622,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
5623,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5624,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5625,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5626,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: Have you ever lost before?
5627,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5628,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5629,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5630,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"

5632,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Yes. Dragons happened.
5633,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5634,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: Aegon and his sisters.
5635,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Mmm?
5636,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,"stark: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5637,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5638,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5639,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5640,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5641,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5642,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5643,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: Most girls are idiots.
5644,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5645,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,stark: From my father.
5646,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
5647,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,stark,"stark: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
5648,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."

We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."

You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."

I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.

5811,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
5812,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
5813,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: You didn't, though."
5814,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: You really remember?
5815,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
5816,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: When I think back to that day-
5817,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,guard: Shh!
5818,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: You were saying?
5819,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
5820,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
5821,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
5822,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: I understand completely.
5823,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
5824,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
5825,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Which knight was it?
5826,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
5827,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: What was he like?
5828,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
5829,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: It's hard to put into words.
5830,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
5831,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
5832,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Did you squire for him again?
5833,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
5834,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
5835,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: And have you thought about
5836,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: Of course. Every day.
5837,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: And?
5838,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
5839,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,"lannister: But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
5840,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: What is it?
5841,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: It's actually quite simple.
5842,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"alton: Well, let me help you."
5843,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: You'll only have to do one thing.
5844,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,alton: Tell me.
5845,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,lannister,lannister: You'll have to die.

5869,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,xaro: There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
5870,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"xaro: You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."

5872,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"xaro: An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."

That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""

The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?""

6120,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."

6137,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,bronn: No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6138,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: We talked about this.
6139,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6140,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."

The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6144,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"varys: And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"

6217,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6218,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6219,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6220,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Because he doesn't have a cock.
6221,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Neither do you.
6222,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."

6224,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Why are you smiling?
6225,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Because I'm happy.

6231,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."

6235,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."

Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6240,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lannister,lannister: And how do I know you haven't killed her already?

6263,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bolton,bolton: He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6264,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

6267,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bolton,bolton: I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.

6271,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6272,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

6274,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: You have every right. You're a king.
6275,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6276,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: What kind do you want to be?
6277,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6278,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa: I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6279,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6280,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa: No. No, you would not."
6281,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6282,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"talisa: When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6283,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6284,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,talisa: I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

6290,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,pie,pie: The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6291,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,baratheon: What did he want us to do about those guards?
6292,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,"stark: He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""

6294,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: He didn't say anything about the guards.

6297,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,baratheon: Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.

6299,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stark,stark: Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

6308,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,"baratheon: Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6309,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."

6313,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6314,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,baratheon: And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6315,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.

6317,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: Some are happy to do it to my face.
6318,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,"baratheon: We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6319,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6320,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,baratheon: No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6321,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,davos: He was only a boy.
6322,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,baratheon: Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6323,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,"baratheon: First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."

6327,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,baratheon,"baratheon: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6328,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"davos: Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."

6385,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,osha: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6386,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: That's it. The tide's against us.
6387,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6388,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: You're coming home.
6389,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6390,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6391,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6392,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6393,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Gods be good.
6394,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6395,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: But not over them?
6396,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6397,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Well, first, we have to put it there."
6398,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6399,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"davos: Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6400,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6401,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: Are you afraid, my lion?"
6402,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6403,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: I won't let them hurt you.
6404,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6405,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: It is now.
6406,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6407,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6408,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6409,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Your words are always wise and measured.
6410,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle: If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6411,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: You brought me something?
6412,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle: Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6413,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: I know what ten drops will bring.
6414,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"pycelle: Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6415,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6416,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,pycelle: Yes. A siege is very-
6417,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6418,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,pycelle: Your Grace.

6420,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: To the boys!

6422,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Drunk Lannisters.
6423,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: You've got a pretty voice.
6424,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Thank you very much.
6425,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6426,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6427,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: Oh.
6428,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6429,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6430,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6431,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,prostitute: Poor nose.
6432,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6433,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
6434,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I don't think he likes me.
6435,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,clegane,clegane: You think you're a hard man?
6436,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I know it.
6437,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6438,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,clegane,"clegane: Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6439,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,clegane,clegane: Only smaller.
6440,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: And quicker. Eh?
6441,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,clegane,clegane: Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6442,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Aye I expect he will someday.
6443,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,man: Here we are.
6444,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6445,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6446,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: A wedding.
6447,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6448,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6449,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6450,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6451,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Do you trust him?
6452,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Oddly enough, I do."
6453,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Good.
6454,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: The map you asked for.
6455,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6456,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6457,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6458,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6459,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Well, I'm not."
6460,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6461,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: What of it?
6462,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6463,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6464,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,varys: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6465,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6466,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6467,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: No, I don't believe you have."
6468,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"varys: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6469,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: They're welcoming the new king.
6470,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6471,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: Drums!
6472,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Remember, wait till the ships-"
6473,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: The ships are in the bay.
6474,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: They must be far enough in-
6475,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6476,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6477,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6478,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Don't get killed.
6479,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Nor you, my friend."
6480,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Oh, are we friends now?"
6481,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6482,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"bronn: Enhances it, really."
6483,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6484,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,bronn: Been spending time with fancy folks.
6485,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6486,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Shae.
6487,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6488,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,"stark: She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6489,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Sansa.
6490,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6491,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Sansa, come here."
6492,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,"stark: I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6493,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Will you?
6494,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: Just as I pray for the king's.
6495,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Stay safe, my lady."
6496,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: And you, my lion."
6497,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6498,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6499,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6500,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: Will you slay him yourself?
6501,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6502,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6503,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6504,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,"stark: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6505,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6506,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Some of those boys will never come back.
6507,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.

6510,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: On the way.
6511,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6512,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6513,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,clegane,clegane: The king has asked you a question.
6514,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6515,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,lancel: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6516,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6517,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6518,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Where are their ships?
6519,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,matthos: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6520,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6521,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"matthos: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6522,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,davos: Maybe.
6523,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6524,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6525,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: I doubt it.
6526,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,shae: Maybe she's jealous of you.
6527,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: Why would she be jealous?
6528,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: Sansa.
6529,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6530,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: Yes.
6531,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6532,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"shae: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6533,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,lannister: So? I didn't offer you water.
6534,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: What's he doing here?
6535,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6536,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stark,stark: But we have guards to defend us.
6537,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6538,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cloak,cloak: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."

6592,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lannister,"lannister: You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."

If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."

He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."

7238,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"salladhor: He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."

7240,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.

7245,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,salladhor: You cannot turn Stannis against her.

7255,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stark,stark: The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.

I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family.

And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."

7290,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,lannister,"lannister: Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."

7293,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae: Why Dorne?
7294,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stark,stark: It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7295,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae: I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.

7301,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"shae: Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7302,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stark,stark: That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7303,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,shae: Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7304,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stark,stark: Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.

7310,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,baelish,baelish: You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...

7312,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,baelish,baelish: How do I know?
7313,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stark,"stark: Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."

7328,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mormont,mormont: We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7329,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,targaryen,targaryen: The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7330,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mormont,mormont: Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7331,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,targaryen,targaryen: It's too beautiful a day to argue.

I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."

7434,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mormont,mormont: Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
7435,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mormont,mormont: You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7436,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mormont,mormont: You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.

7458,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha: We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.

7476,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7477,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.

7488,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: So how shall we pass the time?
7489,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: By putting one foot in front of the other.
7490,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: It's going to be a very dull walk.
7491,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.

Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."

7497,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7498,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: How would you know?
7499,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7500,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Move.
7501,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Were you pledged to Stannis?
7502,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: Gods, no."

7504,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Shut your mouth.
7505,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7506,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"brienne: I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7507,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7508,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I did not fancy him.
7509,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Oh, gods, you did."
7510,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7511,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7512,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7513,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7514,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: Shut your mouth!

7522,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: He knows who I am.
7523,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: He doesn't.
7524,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7525,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,brienne: We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7526,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7527,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Make it tighter here.
7528,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: That's better. It makes you look very strong.

7531,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Bloody flowers. On the king.
7532,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7533,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Tell me what you think of her.
7534,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Who?
7535,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Margaery.
7536,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7537,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."

7539,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7540,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Not to me.
7541,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7542,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7543,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7544,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7545,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: You need to ask yourself
7546,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: I don't need to do anything.
7547,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Better. Much better.

7549,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7550,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7551,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7552,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: Love is not the thing he wants.
7553,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: He's too old.
7554,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?

7575,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."

7579,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7580,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Lemon cake's my favorite.

He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."

I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."

7731,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
7732,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: My lion.
7733,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
7734,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: But you said I should come to you with any problems.
7735,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Did anyone see you? No.
7736,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: No.
7737,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
7738,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: All right. What is this problem?
7739,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
7740,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Baelish doesn't have friends.
7741,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: I don't know her name.
7742,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
7743,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: How do you know her?
7744,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
7745,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: She's a whore.
7746,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
7747,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: You fucked her.
7748,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
7749,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
7750,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: And was she good? Did you like her?
7751,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
7752,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
7753,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
7754,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: We have to protect her.
7755,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."

7757,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
7758,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: You pervert. You want her? This child?
7759,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: I don't even want to talk about her.
7760,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: But you are.
7761,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Only because you're making me.
7762,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
7763,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
7764,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"shae: Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
7765,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: Hmm, yes."
7766,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,shae: Now do you think I'm cruel?
7767,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
7768,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
7769,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"guard: Lady Tyrell, my king."
7770,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Send her in.
7771,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
7772,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
7773,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
7774,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
7775,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
7776,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
7777,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
7778,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
7779,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
7780,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: You failed to do this.
7781,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
7782,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
7783,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
7784,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: What makes you say this?
7785,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
7786,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,"lannister: No, he was a known degenerate."
7787,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
7788,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
7789,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
7790,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: You are the king.
7791,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Yes. I am.
7792,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
7793,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
7794,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
7795,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: The bolt goes here.
7796,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: And then you just aim and-
7797,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
7798,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: It's not unheard of.
7799,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: My father would never let me before-
7800,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
7801,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: May I? Please.
7802,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,tyrell: I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
7803,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
7804,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrell,"tyrell: I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
7805,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",lannister,lannister: Yes.

7808,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Tell us the truth.
7809,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: About what?
7810,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: I don't know what you want.

7812,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: What truth?
7813,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Why'd you take Winterfell?
7814,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: I took it to-I took it-
7815,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Who gave the orders?
7816,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: No one. I took it on my own.
7817,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Why?
7818,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: To take the North while it was vulnerable.
7819,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: What were you going to do once you took it?
7820,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: Hold it. Rule it.
7821,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: Good. That's very good.
7822,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: Why did you do that?
7823,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,torturer: I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
7824,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
7825,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,"greyjoy: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
7826,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: What are you doing?
7827,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",greyjoy,greyjoy: Please.

7836,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Only when I'm asleep.
7837,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
7838,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
7839,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: A three-eyed raven?
7840,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: You've seen it?
7841,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
7842,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Does it have anything to do with warging?
7843,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
7844,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
7845,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
7846,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha: What's he telling him?
7847,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Why don't you ask?
7848,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"osha: Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
7849,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Where's the shame in that?
7850,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,osha: Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
7851,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,meera: Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
7852,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,"stark: When my father died, I dreamt it."

7857,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Yeah.
7858,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
7859,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"jojen: Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."

7861,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,jojen: Only one thing that matters-you.
7862,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"man: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
7863,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: I don't drink ale.
7864,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
7865,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,man: Yeah!
7866,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
7867,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: We're not children.
7868,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
7869,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
7870,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"thoros: A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
7871,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",baratheon,baratheon: King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
7872,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
7873,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",baratheon,baratheon: That's because he's twice as good.
7874,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: Aha! A smith and a salesman.
7875,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: Gendry stole us weapons.

7877,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
7878,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: My brothers taught me.

7882,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",stark,stark: You'll free us?
7883,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,thoros: I gave you my word.

7927,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"edmure: My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
7928,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stark,stark: It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
7929,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: I seized an opportunity.
7930,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stark,stark: What value was the mill?
7931,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
7932,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stark,stark: Is he there now? Of course not.
7933,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,edmure: We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
7934,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stark,"stark: I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."

7945,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stark,stark: You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
7946,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,brynden: We seem to be running short of patience here.

7948,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
7949,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: What news of Jaime?
7950,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,"lannister: Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"

In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
7954,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,"lannister: Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."

7958,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
7959,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,"lannister: Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
7960,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

7962,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
7963,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,"lannister: I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."

The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."

7969,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,lannister,lannister: I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
7970,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"brienne: All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."

One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8337,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,lannister,"lannister: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"

8339,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"varys: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."

8346,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"grenn: But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."

8390,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: They said it was hard to describe.
8391,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8392,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

8398,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: Former profession.
8399,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,varys: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8400,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,ros: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

8490,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
8491,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: He's no crow.
8492,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,orell: Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
8493,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: I'm not afraid of you.
8494,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,"tormund: I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."

8496,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,tormund: We'll find out soon enough.
8497,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: I don't need you to protect me.
8498,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
8499,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: Give it back.
8500,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"ygritte: Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."

8503,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
8504,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: Ygritte.
8505,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
8506,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: All of me.
8507,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: We shouldn't.
8508,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: We should.

8510,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
8511,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
8512,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: Hmm.
8513,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: You seemed to like it.
8514,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"ygritte: Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
8515,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: There's been no one else. Only you.
8516,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: A maid. You were a maid.
8517,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
8518,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: What do you think?
8519,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,snow: Who was he?
8520,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"ygritte: Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
8521,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,snow,"snow: Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"

8523,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,ygritte: How long's it been since you had a bath?
8524,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"ygritte: Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
8525,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,clegane,clegane: I want my gold.
8526,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
8527,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,clegane,clegane: Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
8528,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,anguy,anguy: We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
8529,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,clegane,"clegane: Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
8530,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
8531,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Not in the eyes of god.
8532,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: You can't!
8533,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
8534,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"beric: Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."

8538,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"locke: On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."

8541,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"locke: No, my lord, he has it here."
8542,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,bolton,bolton: Take this away.
8543,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,locke: Send it to his father?
8544,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,bolton,bolton: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
8545,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,bolton,"bolton: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."

8548,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Lord Bolton.
8549,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Is there word from the capital?
8550,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,bolton,bolton: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
8551,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,bolton,bolton: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
8552,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Will I die?
8553,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
8554,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
8555,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
8556,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I don't need my right hand to kill you.
8557,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
8558,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Mmm.
8559,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"qyburn: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
8560,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: No milk of the poppy.
8561,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: There will be pain.
8562,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I'll scream.
8563,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,qyburn: Quite a bit of pain.
8564,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I'll scream loudly.
8565,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Lord Baelish.
8566,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,baelish: Your Grace.
8567,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
8568,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,"baelish: Of course, Your Grace."
8569,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
8570,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,baelish: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
8571,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
8572,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,"baelish: Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
8573,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
8574,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,baelish: I shall do my best.
8575,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
8576,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,baelish: I assure you that it will.
8577,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
8578,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,podrick,"podrick: Pardon, my lady."
8579,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
8580,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
8581,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
8582,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
8583,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: Naturally.
8584,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
8585,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
8586,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I understand that.
8587,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: Good.
8588,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
8589,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: And?
8590,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
8591,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
8592,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
8593,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
8594,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
8595,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
8596,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I would.
8597,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
8598,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
8599,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: My lady-
8600,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
8601,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Quite sufficient. Thank you.
8602,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,"tyrell: Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
8603,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Give me that.

8605,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,baratheon: Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
8606,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: Why?
8607,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,baratheon: I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
8608,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,"stark: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
8609,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,baratheon: The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
8610,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: You don't have to do this.
8611,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,baratheon: I want to. They need good men.
8612,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,"stark: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
8613,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,"baratheon: What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
8614,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
8615,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,"baratheon: He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."

8617,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baratheon,baratheon: You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.

8625,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
8626,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,karstark,karstark: Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
8627,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: They were boys! Look at them.
8628,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,karstark,karstark: Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
8629,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
8630,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,karstark,"karstark: It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"

8632,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,karstark,karstark: Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
8633,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
8634,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"man: Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."

8677,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,beric: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
8678,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,thoros: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

8730,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Don't you mock me.
8731,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.

8733,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I trust you.
8734,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
8735,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Of course.
8736,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
8737,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
8738,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
8739,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
8740,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,brienne: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!

8776,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,targaryen,targaryen: You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
8777,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,targaryen,targaryen: Remove your helmet
8778,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,worm,worm: This one has the honor.
8779,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,targaryen,targaryen: What is your name?
8780,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,worm,worm: Grey Worm.
8781,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,targaryen,targaryen: Grey Worm.
8782,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"missandei: All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."

8784,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,worm,"worm: Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
8785,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: King Robert wanted her dead.
8786,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
8787,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
8788,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: I didn't sit on the small council.
8789,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
8790,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
8791,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
8792,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,"mormont: Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
8793,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: Mm-hmm.
8794,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,"mormont: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
8795,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
8796,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: Which men do you have in mind?
8797,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
8798,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
8799,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
8800,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,"mormont: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
8801,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,barristan: We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
8802,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
8803,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"barristan: If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
8804,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,mormont,mormont: You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.

8806,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: You were right.
8807,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
8808,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: Don't let him.
8809,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
8810,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
8811,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,"stark: Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
8812,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: Give them a new purpose.
8813,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: What?
8814,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"talisa: Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
8815,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
8816,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: What is it?
8817,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,"stark: I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
8818,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
8819,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,talisa: Can you do it?
8820,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
8821,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
8822,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
8823,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stark,stark: Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
8824,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrell,tyrell: And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.

8832,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,loras: That I wanted to.

8842,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,"baelish: It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."

8844,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,baelish,baelish: Lady Margaery wears it that way.

Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."

8860,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
8861,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
8862,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
8863,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
8864,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."

8868,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
8869,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
8870,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
8871,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
8872,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: And how do we do that?
8873,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
8874,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Wonderful.
8875,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: Yes, it is."
8876,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: You can't mean it.

8878,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
8879,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."

8881,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
8882,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,"lannister: There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
8883,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: And if I refuse?
8884,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
8885,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: I was wed. Or don't you remember?
8886,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: Only too well.
8887,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.

8896,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,lannister,lannister: You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.

8975,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,ygritte: Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.

8986,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: What?
8987,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.

8992,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: There's someone out there.
8993,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,anguy: That's about far enough.

9001,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"melisandre: You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."

9012,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"thoros: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9013,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre: You've been to the other side.
9014,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."

9022,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: What does that have to do with anything?
9023,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"beric: Forgive me, lad."

9030,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,baratheon,baratheon: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9031,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,melisandre: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.

If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."

9078,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9079,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,walder,"walder: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9080,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: I don't think that's-
9081,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9082,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,walder,walder: And there's something else.
9083,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9084,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,walder,"walder: Not what, whom."
9085,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: What?
9086,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: No.
9087,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar: Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9088,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: How old is she?
9089,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar: Nineteen.
9090,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: Could I see her first?
9091,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,walder,walder: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9092,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9093,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,lothar: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9094,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,walder,walder: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9095,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9096,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"edmure: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9097,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9098,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9099,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9100,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9101,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9102,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9103,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"edmure: He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9104,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9105,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9106,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,brynden: You recall that heroic engagement?
9107,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: I had something less permanent in mind.
9108,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9109,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,edmure: I'll marry her.
9110,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9111,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9112,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,"brienne: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9113,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,"bolton: When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9114,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: I should send you back to Robb Stark.
9115,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9116,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9117,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9118,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9119,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9120,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9121,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: He'll make time for you.
9122,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,"bolton: As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9123,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Shall we drink on it?
9124,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: I don't partake.
9125,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9126,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9127,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,"bolton: Oh, she won't be going with you."
9128,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,brienne: I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9129,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: You are charged with abetting treason.
9130,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I'm afraid I must insist.
9131,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bolton,bolton: You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9132,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: Impossible.
9133,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Why?
9134,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9135,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9136,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: Old.
9137,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Old?
9138,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9139,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9140,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9141,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9142,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9143,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Of course.
9144,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: And you never-
9145,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: No.
9146,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: Not once? Not in any way?
9147,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Never.
9148,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9149,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9150,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9151,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9152,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9153,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9154,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9155,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9156,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,"tyrell: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9157,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9158,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9159,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: Oh
9160,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9161,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9162,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9163,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrell,tyrell: It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9164,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell: No!
9165,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,orell: We've gotta cut them loose!
9166,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,tormund: No!
9167,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,snow,snow: Take my hand!
9168,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: That's a wonderful pin.
9169,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9170,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: I'm very happy about
9171,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9172,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: I feel like I'm in a dream.
9173,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9174,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9175,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"loras: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9176,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9177,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: We can have them both killed.
9178,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9179,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9180,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: On a boat you built.
9181,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9182,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9183,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9184,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9185,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9186,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: What do you want me to say?
9187,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9188,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9189,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9190,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9191,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9192,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9193,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9194,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Who's going to tell her?
9195,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: Do you think people will like it?
9196,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: I don't think they will even notice it.
9197,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9198,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: I'm sure he does.
9199,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: Will they let me invite my family?
9200,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: They haven't asked my opinion.
9201,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: But do you think they will?
9202,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: No.
9203,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,maid,"maid: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9204,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: I beg your pardon, my lady."
9205,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9206,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9207,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,stark: Of course.
9208,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,"lannister: Alone, if I may."
9209,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,shae: Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9210,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9211,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9212,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,stark,"stark: It's all right, really."
9213,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lannister,lannister: How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9214,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9215,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,baelish,baelish: There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9216,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9217,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,baelish,"baelish: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9218,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"varys: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9219,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,baelish,"baelish: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."

9525,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Is that a palace?
9526,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: It's a windmill.
9527,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
9528,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: Just the men who used to live here.
9529,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
9530,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: Winterfell has towers three times that size.
9531,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
9532,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,"snow: If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
9533,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: What's swooning?
9534,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: Fainting.
9535,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: What's fainting?
9536,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: When a girl sees blood and collapses.
9537,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
9538,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: Well not all girls are like you.
9539,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."

9542,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Would you?
9543,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: So I could tear it off you.
9544,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
9545,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
9546,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
9547,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,"snow: Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
9548,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You know nothing-
9549,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,"snow: Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
9550,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: And how do you know that?
9551,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,"snow: Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
9552,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: Mance is different.
9553,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,snow: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
9554,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: You don't know that.
9555,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,snow,"snow: I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
9556,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,ygritte: All of us.
9557,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"ygritte: You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."

9561,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: That's where we are.
9562,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: What are you telling him?
9563,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,stark,"stark: It's all right, Osha."
9564,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
9565,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,meera,meera: Leave him alone.
9566,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: He can speak for himself.
9567,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: I don't fill his head with anything.
9568,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: So what do you talk about?
9569,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: What's happening to him and what that means.
9570,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
9571,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
9572,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
9573,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: We're not going to Castle Black.
9574,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: What did you say?
9575,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,jojen: I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
9576,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
9577,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,stark,stark: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
9578,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,osha: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
9579,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,stark,stark: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
9580,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
9581,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,stark,stark: You don't understand. You don't know.
9582,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
9583,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"osha: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
9584,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: How is the pain, my lord?"
9585,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
9586,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: Well, we've stymied the corruption."
9587,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,"lannister: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
9588,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: All the good it's done me.
9589,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
9590,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: Faint praise, my lord."
9591,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
9592,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
9593,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: What is?
9594,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
9595,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: You performed experiments on living men.
9596,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: On dying men.
9597,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: With their permission?
9598,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
9599,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,"lannister: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
9600,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"qyburn: How many men have you killed, my lord?"
9601,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: I don't know.
9602,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Fifty? A hundred?
9603,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: Countless.
9604,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: Countless has a nice ring to it.
9605,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: And how many lives have you saved?
9606,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
9607,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
9608,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: A fair offer.
9609,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,qyburn: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
9610,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: Why not?

9625,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,lannister,lannister: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.

9660,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,clegane,clegane: The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
9661,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stark,stark: Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
9662,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,clegane,clegane: Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
9663,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stark,stark: But why?
9664,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,clegane,clegane: Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
9665,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stark,stark: Why would they be at the Twins?
9666,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,clegane,clegane: Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
9667,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,barristan: Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
9668,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mormont,mormont: They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.

9675,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Enough to make a difference?
9676,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
9677,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mormont,mormont: I imagine you're right.
9678,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

9680,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

9685,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

9694,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
9695,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: You're very young to be a captain.
9696,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

9702,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: I would pay you as much and more.
9703,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,"prendahl: Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
9704,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
9705,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.

9723,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."

9735,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: I didn't know she'd been gone.
9736,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
9737,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: Why?
9738,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: She says there's power in king's blood.

9740,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: Sacrifice him.

9742,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
9743,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: Because he has your blood in his veins.
9744,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: So did Renly.
9745,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
9746,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,"baratheon: How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"

9748,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
9749,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,davos: I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
9750,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: You have little regard for your own life.
9751,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"davos: Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
9752,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,"baratheon: I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
9753,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.

9755,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
9756,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
9757,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
9758,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

9765,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
9766,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: You'll die young.
9767,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,prendahl: What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
9768,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,mero: There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.

9798,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?

If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"

9807,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Could you-
9808,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Thank you.

9811,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
9812,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
9813,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
9814,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Here, taste this."
9815,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: You think I'm trying to poison you?
9816,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: That's good.
9817,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: That's really good.
9818,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: Where do you think it's from?
9819,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: I couldn't even guess.
9820,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
9821,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,"baratheon: That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
9822,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: There are no mistakes. Not for us.
9823,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
9824,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
9825,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
9826,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"melisandre: According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."

9833,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: Why are you doing this?
9834,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
9835,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,"baratheon: No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
9836,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,melisandre: You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
9837,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,"baratheon: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
9838,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,baratheon,baratheon: The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
9839,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrell,"tyrell: So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."

9842,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
9843,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: I've got a lifetime for that.
9844,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Stay.
9845,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: You seem rather drunk.
9846,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
9847,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."

9851,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: More than once.
9852,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
9853,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."

9859,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stark,"stark: Yes, Your Grace."
9860,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
9861,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
9862,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Time for the bedding ceremony.
9863,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: There will be no bedding ceremony.

9866,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
9867,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: What did you say? What did you say?
9868,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
9869,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
9870,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
9871,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
9872,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,"lannister: My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."

9878,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: Astoundingly long.

9887,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,lannister,lannister: And so my watch begins.

9890,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
9891,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
9892,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,"targaryen: Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
9893,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
9894,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
9895,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,missandei: Athjahakar.
9896,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Athjahaka.

9908,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I don't want to.
9909,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: What do your captains have to say about that?
9910,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: You should ask them.
9911,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Why?
9912,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: We had philosophical differences.
9913,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Over what?
9914,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
9915,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: You're a strange man.
9916,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
9917,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: And this is supposed to impress me?
9918,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: Yes.
9919,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
9920,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,daario: They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
9921,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Will you fight for me?
9922,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,targaryen,targaryen: Swear to me.

9925,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,shae,shae: I brought your breakfast.
9926,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
9927,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: How hard can it be to build a fire?
9928,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
9929,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: He winked at me before.
9930,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I doubt it.

9933,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
9934,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: A what?
9935,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
9936,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: A wink is on purpose.
9937,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
9938,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
9939,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: What? No. This is just the way I talk.
9940,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I'll build that fire.
9941,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Don't you think he should have a name?
9942,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: I don't know many boys' names.

9947,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
9948,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Why is it a last name?
9949,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
9950,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly: His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
9951,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"sam: No, Randyll Tarly."
9952,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Randyll is a handsome name.

9954,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,gilly: Is your father cruel like mine?
9955,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,sam: Different manner of cruel.
9956,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"gilly: Not Randyll, then."

9970,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
9971,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.

9989,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,"stark: My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."

Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
9994,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"walder: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."

10001,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."

10003,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,daario: I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
10004,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
10005,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,barristan: We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10006,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10007,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10008,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,mormont,"mormont: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10009,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"daario: You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10010,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,mormont,mormont: You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
10011,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,targaryen,"targaryen: Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."

10017,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tarly,"tarly: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10018,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: How do you know all that?

10022,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: You're like a wizard.
10023,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,gilly: Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
10024,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,clegane,clegane: Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

10027,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,farmer,farmer: Need about eight hands.
10028,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,farmer,farmer: Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.

10035,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,clegane,clegane: That so?
10036,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.

10038,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: No.

10064,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,ygritte: He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10065,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,snow,snow: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10066,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"tormund: I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."

10081,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: Might do.
10082,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,clegane,clegane: Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

10086,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10087,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10088,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,osha: Some climb straight up the ice.
10089,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,stark,stark: Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

10269,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: What are you doing?
10270,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I have a list.
10271,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: A list of people you mean to kill?
10272,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10273,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: You should learn to ignore them.
10274,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10275,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10276,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10277,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: So how should we punish them?
10278,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Who? Whom?
10279,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10280,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10281,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: I hear that you're a pervert.
10282,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10283,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10284,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Lady Sansa!
10285,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10286,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Why sheep shift?
10287,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: That's the vulgar word for dung.
10288,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: My lady-
10289,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: Well, you asked me."
10290,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,girl,girl: Oh! That's him!

10295,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10296,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10297,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10298,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10299,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10300,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10301,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10302,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10303,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10304,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10305,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"pycelle: Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10306,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I am the king! I will punish you.
10307,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10308,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10309,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10310,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Come along.
10311,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I'm not tired.
10312,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10313,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10314,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I'm not tired!
10315,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Come.
10316,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Not you.
10317,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10318,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10319,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10320,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: You really think a crown gives you power?
10321,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: No. I think armies give you power.
10322,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Mm-hmm.
10323,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10324,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10325,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10326,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10327,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10328,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10329,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10330,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: The Northerners will never forget.
10331,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10332,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10333,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10334,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10335,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I will not rape her.
10336,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10337,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10338,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10339,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Does that amuse you?
10340,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10341,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Easy for me, is it?"
10342,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10343,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10344,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Sansa.
10345,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: It's empty.
10346,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Let's find a place to sleep.
10347,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,hodor: Hodor. Hodor.
10348,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: Don't, Hodor."
10349,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: Maybe we shouldn't stay.
10350,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: You'd rather be out there?
10351,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10352,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: I always quite liked the horrible stories.
10353,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: So did I. Once.
10354,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10355,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: No. Who's he?
10356,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10357,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
10358,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10359,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
10360,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: The Blackfish escaped.
10361,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10362,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: As you say.
10363,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10364,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: You'll be needing a new young girl.
10365,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
10366,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10367,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
10368,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10369,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
10370,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: Forever young.
10371,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10372,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10373,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,"frey: Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10374,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10375,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey,frey: Oh. And?
10376,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
10377,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,"bolton: Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10378,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10379,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10380,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,"bolton: Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10381,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10382,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: But my father taught me to aim for their head.
10383,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: Kill me.
10384,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,"bolton: Sorry, what?"
10385,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: A little louder.

10390,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
10391,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: Theon Greyjoy.
10392,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bolton,bolton: What's your name?

10408,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Doesn't matter.
10409,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
10410,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: No, I'm not."
10411,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
10412,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,hodor: Hodor.
10413,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
10414,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: Take us north of the Wall.
10415,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: What? Why in the world would you want to go-
10416,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: I don't want to. I have to.
10417,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: How did you get through the Wall?
10418,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10419,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10420,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
10421,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10422,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10423,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10424,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
10425,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: How do you know all that?
10426,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10427,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: But you're going to stop them?
10428,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
10429,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
10430,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
10431,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
10432,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Theon disobeyed my orders.
10433,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"balon: The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
10434,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: He's your son.
10435,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Son? He's not a man anymore.
10436,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10437,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,balon: Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
10438,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10439,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
10440,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,man: Get those ropes!
10441,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
10442,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: What is it?
10443,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,jojen: Dragonglass.
10444,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
10445,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: Why? What are they for?
10446,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,sam: Killing White Walkers.
10447,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: How do you know that?
10448,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,gilly: The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
10449,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,meera: But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
10450,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10451,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,"stark: Take it, Hodor."
10452,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"sam: And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
10453,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stark,stark: I wish I could. I really do.
10454,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: How are you keeping?
10455,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: Great. Never better.
10456,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: It was just a bit of blood.
10457,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,"baratheon: I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10458,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I'm not a highborn.
10459,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: She called you Ser. I heard it.
10460,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10461,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,"baratheon: Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10462,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I lived below the Street of Flour.
10463,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10464,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10465,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: Gin Alley.
10466,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
10467,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,"baratheon: Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
10468,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
10469,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,"baratheon: You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
10470,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10471,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: So how'd you become a lord?
10472,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"davos: Oh, that's a long story."
10473,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,"baratheon: Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10474,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10475,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: You see? Highborns.
10476,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10477,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: Why did you?
10478,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10479,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: Does he?
10480,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: He's dead.
10481,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,baratheon,baratheon: How'd he die?
10482,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,davos: Following me.
10483,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: When did you come to this strange country?
10484,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: When I was thirteen.
10485,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: You were only a child.
10486,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10487,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10488,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10489,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10490,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10491,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: No, I expect not."
10492,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10493,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
10494,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: I have a name.
10495,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,varys: You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
10496,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"shae: What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
10497,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
10498,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: Why do you want me to leave?
10499,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"varys: Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
10500,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,shae: Lord Varys.
10501,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"shae: If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
10502,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Keep up.

10504,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
10505,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Leave.
10506,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
10507,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: She doesn't deserve this.
10508,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
10509,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
10510,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10511,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10512,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10513,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10514,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10515,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: So she can have some happiness in her life.
10516,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: You have children. How happy would you say you are?
10517,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
10518,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Even Joffrey?
10519,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
10520,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: How long does it go on?
10521,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
10522,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,"lannister: Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
10523,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,lannister,lannister: Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

10526,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,soldier,soldier: That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
10527,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,soldier,"soldier: I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."

10529,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,soldier,soldier: I did.

I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."

And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."

10865,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,shae: Do you love her?
10866,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
10867,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,shae: That's not an answer.
10868,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Of course I don't love her.

10875,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,shae: You want me to stay?

10877,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
10878,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
10879,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Days?
10880,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
10881,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Uh... a hook would be more practical.
10882,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: Elegant, I think."
10883,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Thank you for your help with the other matter.

10889,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: What symptoms?
10890,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Symptoms that are not your concern.
10891,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You let him touch you?
10892,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You jealous?
10893,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
10894,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
10895,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
10896,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: Well, they smell like Pycelle."

10898,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Yes.
10899,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Why?
10900,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
10901,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: It must have been traumatic for you.
10902,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
10903,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: A rather short siege.
10904,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
10905,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Father disowned me today.
10906,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
10907,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You're forgetting Tyrion.
10908,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
10909,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
10910,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Not now.
10911,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
10912,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Something's changed.
10913,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
10914,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: What do you want me to apologize for?
10915,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: For leaving me.
10916,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
10917,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
10918,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,"lannister: Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
10919,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: You took too long.
10920,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: I... What are you saying?
10921,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: I'm saying you took too long.
10922,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Come in.
10923,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,lannister,lannister: Go away.
10924,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,marei,"marei: Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
10925,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
10926,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,ygritte: Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
10927,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: We wait for Mance's orders.
10928,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"ygritte: You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
10929,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund: And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
10930,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"ygritte: Yeah, well, he's a liar."
10931,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund: He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."

10936,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: How did you find us?
10937,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"tormund: You came from the south, not the north."
10938,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,warg,warg: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
10939,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
10940,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: Help yourself.
10941,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
10942,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
10943,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
10944,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,tormund: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
10945,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: She yours?
10946,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,ygritte: I'm not anybody's.
10947,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,styr: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
10948,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
10949,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"styr: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."

I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."

10960,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,thorne,thorne: No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?

10964,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,thorne,thorne: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
10965,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,snow,"snow: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."

They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.

11169,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: I'm not hungry.
11170,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."

11177,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: What about your left?
11178,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
11179,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
11180,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
11181,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
11182,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
11183,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
11184,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.

11186,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: Is this place safe?

11189,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"bronn: Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."

11194,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn: Best time to attack a man.
11195,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn: Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
11196,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,bronn: Plan on growing it back?
11197,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: Come on, then."

11207,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
11208,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
11209,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
11210,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: Father.
11211,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: What did you do to him?
11212,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11213,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: You flayed him.
11214,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11215,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11216,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11217,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"roose: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11218,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11219,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11220,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11221,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11222,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11223,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: I placed far too much trust in you.
11224,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11225,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I'm sorry, my lord."
11226,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: Give him the razor.
11227,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11228,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11229,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11230,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I don't know, my lord."
11231,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11232,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11233,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,greyjoy,"greyjoy: No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11234,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,bolton: And crisped them so no one would know.
11235,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Yes, my lord."
11236,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."

11239,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,trant,trant: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11240,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11241,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,greyjoy,greyjoy: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
11242,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,locke: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
11243,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,roose: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11244,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bolton,"bolton: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."

Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."

11247,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.

11251,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
11252,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,"varys: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11253,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
11254,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,varys: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.

11314,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,baratheon: A good deal more than you.

11317,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,baratheon: Meat's off.
11318,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: Our larders are almost empty.
11319,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,"baratheon: Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
11320,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: You hate fish.
11321,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,"baratheon: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
11322,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse: When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
11323,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,baratheon: Of course I remember.
11324,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"selyse: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"

11326,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: Until you found the Lord of Light?
11327,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre: Until he found me.
11328,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: I fear for our daughter's soul.
11329,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre: Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
11330,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: She's a stubborn little beast.
11331,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,baratheon: She's a child.
11332,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
11333,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,baratheon,baratheon: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
11334,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,selyse: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.

11336,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre: Were you sleeping, Princess?"

11338,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: I heard it.
11339,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre: And it frightened you?
11340,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
11341,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
11342,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: But they screamed.
11343,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,melisandre: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
11344,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
11345,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
11346,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: And you didn't have this.
11347,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"

11349,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"melisandre: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
11350,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,shireen: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?

11357,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stark,stark: I was just eating.
11358,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"jojen: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
11359,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"jojen: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
11360,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,"meera: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."

11365,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stark,stark: I know where we have to go.

11371,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,tyrell: It feels proportionate.
11372,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: Proportionate to what?
11373,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,tyrell: The expected extravagance.
11374,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
11375,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,tyrell: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
11376,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,"tyrell: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
11377,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,"tyrell: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."

11379,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,"tyrell: No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
11380,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
11395,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,lannister: My lady. My lady.
11396,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrell,"tyrell: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."

11410,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,lannister,"lannister: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.

I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."

11557,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,baelish,"baelish: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."

11559,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,baelish,baelish: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
11560,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stark,stark: He saved me.

11568,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,"tyrell: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
11569,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,"tyrell: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
11570,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,"tyrell: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."

11572,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,tyrell: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
11573,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,tyrell: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
11574,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,"tyrell: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
11575,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,tyrell: But I would have been the queen.
11576,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrell,tyrell: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
11577,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
11578,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I'm not trying to trick you.
11579,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: It means I'll become king.

11581,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: A good king?
11582,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
11583,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: This is hardly the place or the time.
11584,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Holiness?
11585,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
11586,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Justice.
11587,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
11588,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: No.
11589,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: No.
11590,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: What about strength?
11591,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
11592,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Wisdom.
11593,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Yes!
11594,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Wisdom is what makes a good king.
11595,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
11596,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
11597,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: A king needs a queen.
11598,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"

11647,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,hamlet,hamlet: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
11648,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?

11653,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stark,stark: Really good.
11654,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,hamlet,hamlet: Did you fight at the Twins?
11655,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
11656,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,hamlet,hamlet: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
11657,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: Guest right don't mean much anymore.
11658,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,hamlet,"hamlet: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."

11661,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: How can a man not keep ale in his home?
11662,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,hamlet,"hamlet: You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
11663,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
11664,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: Fair wages for fair work.
11665,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stark,stark: What did you do?!
11666,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: Get your horse saddled.

11670,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,"clegane: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."

11672,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
11673,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stark,stark: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
11674,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,clegane,clegane: There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?

11680,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam: They all think I'm lying.

11691,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly: I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.

11703,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly: For worrying about me.

11751,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos: It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
11752,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,davos: To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.

11762,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly: He's dead.
11763,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,whore,whore: Oh. Where you from?

11765,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,whore,whore: North of here? You a fucking wildling?
11766,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,madam,madam: Only room and board?
11767,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam: That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
11768,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,madam,"madam: Could find other work for her, too."

11771,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,sam: I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
11772,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly: You protected me north of the Wall.
11773,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"sam: This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."

11775,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,gilly: Best for you.

11784,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: Does that surprise you?
11785,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar: Everyone has a preference.
11786,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
11787,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar: I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.

11789,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,ellaria: Children.
11790,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
11791,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,olyvar: Did you?
11792,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,ellaria: He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
11793,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: They will all have to line up behind you.

11801,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: I'm sorry about your grandson.
11802,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Are you?
11803,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
11804,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Which way is that?
11805,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
11806,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Some believe the king choked.
11807,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
11808,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
11809,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: I did. This is why I know.
11810,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
11811,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
11812,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
11813,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: You think we conspired together?
11814,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: What did you discuss?
11815,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: The death of my sister.
11816,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: For which you blame me.
11817,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
11818,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
11819,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
11820,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
11821,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
11822,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Categorically.
11823,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: I would like to speak with the Mountain.
11824,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
11825,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
11826,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I could arrange for this meeting.
11827,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: But you want something in return.
11828,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
11829,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: Why?
11830,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
11831,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
11832,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
11833,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,"martell: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
11834,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
11835,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,martell,martell: You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
11836,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
11837,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
11838,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
11839,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: A noble effort.
11840,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
11841,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
11842,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I've heard nothing, my lord."
11843,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
11844,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
11845,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
11846,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: No, my lord. You didn't?"
11847,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
11848,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: Your father.
11849,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Of course.
11850,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: Mace Tyrell.
11851,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
11852,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
11853,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
11854,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
11855,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
11856,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: My lord, she's gone."
11857,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Gone?
11858,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
11859,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."

11861,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: They'll be following you now.

11863,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
11864,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: Any other witnesses, my lord?"
11865,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

11867,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
11868,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
11869,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Why not?
11870,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,podrick: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
11871,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
11872,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: I'll ask, my lord."
11873,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"podrick: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
11874,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,lannister: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

11878,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,lannister,"lannister: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."

Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

12043,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12044,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12045,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12046,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12047,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: How absentminded of me.
12048,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Mm-hmm.
12049,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12050,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12051,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: Well, he could have done."
12052,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: He could have done,but he didn't."
12053,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: You don't know, Grandmother."
12054,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12055,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: What? I don't understand.
12056,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12057,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Bring it through! And again.
12058,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Very nice. Good.
12059,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12060,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Let's see what you can do.
12061,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,"snow: Olly, you just watch for now."
12062,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,olly: I can fight.
12063,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12064,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,olly: I was!
12065,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grenn,"grenn: I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12066,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,"snow: You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
12067,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12068,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12069,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorne,thorne: Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12070,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Grenn and I were helping them.
12071,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorn,"thorn: Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12072,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Someone has to train them.
12073,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorne,thorne: And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
12074,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorne,thorne: Get back to work. Now! I said now!
12075,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slynt,slynt: The bastardo s well-liked.You're not.
12076,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorne,thorne: You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
12077,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slynt,slynt: For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12078,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"locke: A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12079,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12080,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: Name's Locke.
12081,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Jon Snow.
12082,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: You fight well.
12083,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12084,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,thorne,"thorne: Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12085,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,locke: Guess I was wrong.
12086,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: You sent for me, Your Grace?"
12087,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12088,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12089,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12090,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12091,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12092,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: What?
12093,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12094,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12095,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: She hoped or did you promise?
12096,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12097,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12098,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12099,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12100,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12101,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12102,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12103,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: And?
12104,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: He didn't do it, Cersei."
12105,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12106,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Ser Pounce?
12107,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: How did you get past the Kingsguard?
12108,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Kingsguard.
12109,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12110,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12111,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12112,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Yes. But if my mother found out...
12113,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,"tyrell: It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12114,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Yes? Tell me a secret.
12115,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12116,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: That's Ser Pounce.
12117,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: Very handsome.
12118,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12119,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12120,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: No. I don't think I am.
12121,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrell,tyrell: That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12122,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."

12126,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
12127,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,brienne: Valyrian steel.
12128,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Mmm. It's yours.
12129,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,brienne: I can't accept this.
12130,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,"lannister: It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12131,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I hope I got your measurements right.

12133,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12134,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,brienne: I don't need a squire.
12135,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: Of course you do.
12136,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,brienne: He'll slow me down.
12137,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,lannister,lannister: My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.

12148,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,"sam: She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
12149,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: Castle Black could be next.
12150,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,sam: I should go back for Gilly.

12156,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,sam: I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
12157,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,snow,snow: The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...

I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"

12219,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,tanner: I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?

The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years.

12332,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
12333,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,baelish,baelish: Like it was yesterday.
12334,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
12335,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,baelish,baelish: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
12336,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,baelish,"baelish: Tonight it is, then."
12337,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,baelish,"baelish: Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."

12340,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
12341,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: A fortnight?
12342,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: That seems reasonable.
12343,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
12344,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: And your wedding to Loras?
12345,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Shortly after Tommen's.
12346,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Shortly?
12347,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: A fortnight.
12348,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
12349,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: We had that in common.
12350,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
12351,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Then whom can we trust?
12352,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Ourselves alone.
12353,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
12354,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Robert wasn't particularly rich.
12355,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
12356,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
12357,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
12358,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Haven't a clue.
12359,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: Go on, your best guess."
12360,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: Pounds, tons, ounces?"
12361,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
12362,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: That can't be.
12363,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
12364,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Then how do we pay for anything?
12365,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
12366,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: How much?
12367,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: A tremendous amount.
12368,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
12369,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
12370,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
12371,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
12372,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
12373,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,"lannister: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
12374,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
12375,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lannister,lannister: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
12376,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
12377,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,clegane,clegane: Would you shut up?
12378,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: I can't sleep until I say the names.
12379,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,clegane,clegane: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
12380,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: Only the ones I'm going to kill.
12381,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,clegane,"clegane: Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."

12383,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,clegane,"clegane: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
12384,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: I'm almost done. Only one name left.
12385,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,clegane,clegane: Go on.
12386,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: The Hound.

12388,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
12389,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,stark: Really?
12390,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
12391,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,stark,"stark: My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."

12394,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"lysa: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."

Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"

He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."

12902,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: Shae. Please don't.

12906,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
12907,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
12908,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,"lannister: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
12909,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: You admit you poisoned the king?
12910,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,"lannister: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
12911,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
12912,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,"lannister: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
12913,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: Have you nothing to say in your defense?
12914,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,"lannister: Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
12915,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,"lannister: Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
12916,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
12917,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
12918,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,lannister,lannister: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
12919,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
12920,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
12921,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
12922,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
12923,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: You fell in love with a whore.
12924,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
12925,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
12926,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: At least I got to tell them what they really are.
12927,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
12928,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
12929,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
12930,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
12931,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
12932,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: It is tempting.
12933,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
12934,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: If he wins.
12935,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
12936,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: No. Not Ser Meryn.

12943,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Does it matter?
12944,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: Could be food.
12945,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Could be soldiers.
12946,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
12947,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,"man: Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."

12949,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: I stopped asking a while ago.
12950,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: That's not gonna get better.
12951,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Doesn't seem so.
12952,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
12953,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
12954,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: So why go on?
12955,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Habit.
12956,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Nothing could be worse than this.
12957,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Maybe nothing is worse than this.
12958,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
12959,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Who are you?
12960,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
12961,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: You her father?
12962,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
12963,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,"man: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
12964,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,man: Wish it were wine.
12965,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: So do I.
12966,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
12967,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: The fuck you doing?
12968,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge: There's a price on your head.
12969,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
12970,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge: The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
12971,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,"clegane: And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
12972,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
12973,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
12974,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: He can't be. I don't know his name.
12975,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: What's your name?
12976,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,rorge: Rorge.

12988,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
12989,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,slynt,"slynt: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
12990,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: We need to prepare.
12991,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: We've been preparing.
12992,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
12993,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: And how would we range north?
12994,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: We wouldn't.
12995,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
12996,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,grenn,grenn: We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
12997,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
12998,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,"snow: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
12999,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13000,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: They won't stop them.
13001,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13002,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: The stewards.

13004,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: No.
13005,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,alliser: Who would that be?
13006,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,snow,snow: The builders.
13007,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13008,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,yarwick: No.
13009,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"alliser: Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."

13014,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13015,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I sent for you days ago.
13016,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I've been a bit busy.
13017,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Doing what?
13018,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13019,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13020,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13021,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: She's dim-witted.
13022,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13023,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13024,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13025,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13026,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: Falyse is forty and barren.
13027,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13028,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13029,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13030,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13031,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13032,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13033,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13034,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13035,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13036,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13037,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13038,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13039,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13040,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Does he frighten you so much?
13041,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13042,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Because you're my friend.
13043,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13044,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"bronn: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13045,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I understand.
13046,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13047,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13048,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: We had some good days together.

13051,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13052,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,bronn: I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13053,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,"targaryen: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13054,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: But your window is not.
13055,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13056,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Don't do that again.
13057,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13058,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,"targaryen: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13059,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13060,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Tell me why you're here.
13061,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13062,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13063,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13064,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,"targaryen: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13065,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"daario: There is only one, and she does not want me."
13066,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: You swore me your sword.
13067,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: My sword is yours till the day I die.
13068,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13069,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13070,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Very well.
13071,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Do what you do best.
13072,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Take off your clothes.
13073,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Oh.
13074,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: Come in, my queen. Please."
13075,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13076,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: You could never disturb me.
13077,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13078,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13079,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13080,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13081,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13082,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13083,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13084,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: Not always.
13085,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13086,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Did you use it with Stannis?
13087,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13088,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13089,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"selyse: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13090,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: I understand how you feel.
13091,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Hmm.
13092,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,melisandre: But that is impossible.
13093,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,selyse: Why?
13094,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
13095,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"melisandre: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13096,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,daario: Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13097,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: Khaleesi.
13098,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: You're here early.
13099,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: Later than some.
13100,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: You don't approve?
13101,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13102,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: You neither approve nor trust.
13103,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13104,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13105,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: I did.
13106,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: I trust you.
13107,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13108,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13109,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: You have?
13110,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: I have.
13111,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13112,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,"targaryen: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13113,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13114,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13115,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13116,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13117,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13118,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13119,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13120,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13121,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,mormont: Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13122,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13123,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,"targaryen: Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13124,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mormont,"mormont: Yes, Khaleesi."
13125,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,targaryen,targaryen: No. Tell him you changed my mind.
13126,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
13127,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,"stark: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13128,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: No fire.
13129,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13130,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: No fire!
13131,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,"clegane: Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13132,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,"clegane: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13133,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,clegane: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13134,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Why?
13135,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,clegane,"clegane: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13136,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13137,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13138,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13139,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13140,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Yes, my lady."
13141,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Don't get drunk.
13142,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: No, my lady."
13143,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: Can I get you anything else?
13144,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13145,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: Thanks. I do my best.
13146,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13147,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: No.
13148,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13149,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: We're looking for someone.
13150,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13151,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13152,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13153,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13154,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13155,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13156,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: What?
13157,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: It's nothing, my lady."
13158,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13159,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13160,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13161,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13162,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13163,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: What about? Not kidney pie.
13164,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13165,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13166,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13167,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: When was that?
13168,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13169,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: So what happened to her?
13170,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: Well-
13171,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: The quick version.
13172,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,pie: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13173,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: The Hound.
13174,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,pie,"pie: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13175,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Um, you were saying?"
13176,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13177,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13178,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: Why the Eyrie?
13179,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13180,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"brienne: Sansa could be there, too."
13181,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"podrick: Aye, my lady. Could be."
13182,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,brienne: You sure about this?
13183,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,podrick: No.
13184,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13185,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13186,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13187,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: Your sister.
13188,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: Oh.
13189,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.

13191,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13192,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13193,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,"martell: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13194,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: I think I would have remembered that.
13195,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,"martell: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13196,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13197,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,"martell: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13198,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,lannister: That would have made things so much easier.
13199,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,"martell: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13200,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13201,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13202,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lannister,"lannister: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13203,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,martell: I disagree.
13204,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,martell,"martell: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13205,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,"stark: Hello, Robin."

13207,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,"stark: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."

13209,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: It's a long story.
13210,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13211,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,"stark: Yes, you certainly are."
13212,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: When will you go back?
13213,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13214,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13215,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,"stark: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13216,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13217,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: We don't.
13218,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13219,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13220,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,"robin: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13221,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: I like the sound of that.
13222,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13223,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: All right.
13224,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: It can go in here in this big tower.
13225,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13226,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I didn't ruin it.
13227,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: You did.
13228,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13229,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13230,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,robin: I didn't ruin it!
13231,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,stark,stark: You're being stupid.

I know what you did."

13336,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,worm,worm: in Valyrian* So am I.
13337,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,"bolton: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
13338,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
13339,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,bolton: And what are you really?
13340,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm Reek.
13341,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,"bolton: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
13342,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,bolton: Until when?
13343,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Always. Forever.
13344,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,bolton: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
13345,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,guard: to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
13346,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
13347,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Yes.
13348,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: And why should I believe that?
13349,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
13350,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,everyone,everyone: What is dead may never die.
13351,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
13352,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
13353,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: And what does Lord Bolton want?
13354,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
13355,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: He wants us to surrender?
13356,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,"greyjoy: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
13357,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: shame fought with honor.
13358,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
13359,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
13360,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: scared* You don't know.
13361,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,ralf: The Ironborn will not surrender.
13362,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: whispering* Reek. Reek.
13363,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"ralf: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
13364,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Reek.
13365,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"man: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
13366,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
13367,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,"bolton: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
13368,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,greyjoy,greyjoy: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
13369,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,bolton,bolton: I believe we will. To our new home.
13370,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
13371,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
13372,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
13373,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
13374,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: My lord...
13375,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
13376,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
13377,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
13378,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
13379,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
13380,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
13381,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
13382,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: We were told there was a witness. A girl.
13383,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: A niece of yours, I believe."
13384,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
13385,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: We'd like to speak with her.
13386,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: Let me fetch her.
13387,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
13388,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
13389,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: My lady...
13390,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: I wasn't asking you.
13391,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,stark: He can stay.
13392,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
13393,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,"stark: to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
13394,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
13395,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,"stark: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
13396,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
13397,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,"stark: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
13398,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,vance,"vance: Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
13399,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
13400,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
13401,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,"stark: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
13402,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: Lady Sansa.
13403,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,stark,"stark: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
13404,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
13405,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
13406,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
13407,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
13408,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
13409,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
13410,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
13411,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: Are you questioning our courage?
13412,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
13413,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,royce: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
13414,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
13415,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,"anya: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
13416,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
13417,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
13418,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,petyr: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
13419,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,anya,anya: More often they die young.
13420,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
13421,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,royce,"royce: Aye, it's time."
13422,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"petyr: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
13423,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,boy,boy: Ser Barristan.

13427,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Have I forgotten a council meeting?
13428,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,barristan,barristan: No.
13429,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: What's this?
13430,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,barristan,barristan: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
13431,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Who gave you this?
13432,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,barristan,barristan: Does it matter?
13433,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Have you told her?
13434,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,barristan,"barristan: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
13435,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Let me speak with her in private.
13436,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,barristan,barristan: You'll never be alone with her again.
13437,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: Why did the usurper pardon you?
13438,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: If we could speak alone.
13439,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,"targaryen: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
13440,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,"jorah: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
13441,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
13442,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: It is not forged.
13443,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,"targaryen: Why, then?"
13444,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,"jorah: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."

13446,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Information.
13447,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: What information?
13448,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
13449,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13450,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: I...
13451,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: Yes or no?
13452,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Khaleesi.
13453,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13454,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: Yes.
13455,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
13456,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: I stopped you from drinking his wine.
13457,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: Because you knew it was poisoned.
13458,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: I suspected.
13459,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: You betrayed me from the first.
13460,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,"jorah: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
13461,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
13462,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
13463,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,targaryen,targaryen: and you want me to forgive you?
13464,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jorah,jorah: I have loved you.

You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."

13519,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Soon.

13524,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
13525,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Beheading.

13527,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Cousins.
13528,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
13529,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
13530,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
13531,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,together,together: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
13532,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Nothing made him happier.
13533,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
13534,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
13535,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: The joke wore thin, though."
13536,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: For you. You drifted away.
13537,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: I had other interests.
13538,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
13539,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Why?
13540,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
13541,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
13542,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
13543,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
13544,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
13545,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: He was twice your size.
13546,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,"lannister: He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
13547,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: I don't know.
13548,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Good luck today.
13549,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: Looks like very light armor.

13551,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
13552,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,martell,martell: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
13553,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lannister,lannister: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

13600,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
13601,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
13602,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
13603,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte: I probably killed him already.
13604,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr: So you've said.
13605,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,ygritte: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
13606,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
13607,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"ygritte: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
13608,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,styr: Maybe I have.

13611,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: Maester Aemon. How did you know-
13612,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
13613,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: Let me help you.
13614,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
13615,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: Maester Faull
13616,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
13617,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
13618,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
13619,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: I don't love her.
13620,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: Yes you do.
13621,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: No.
13622,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
13623,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: You were?
13624,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"aemon: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
13625,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"sam: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
13626,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
13627,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,sam: Who was she?
13628,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,aemon: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.

It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back.

A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain.

A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."

14217,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?

14221,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14222,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: It's where she belonged.
14223,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14224,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
14225,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
14226,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
14227,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
14228,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,"snow: Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14229,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,"baratheon: If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
14230,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,davos: It's a fair offer. More than fair.
14231,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14232,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: I don't think that's likely.

14234,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: I respect him.
14235,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...

14237,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,baratheon: or he burns.
14238,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: How much time do I have?
14239,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baratheon,"baratheon: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."

14241,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
14242,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,baelish: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
14243,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
14244,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,squire,squire: My lord.

14247,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14248,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,baelish: He has other gifts.
14249,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,royce: Does he?
14250,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,baelish: The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
14251,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stark,"stark: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
14252,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"royce: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."

14256,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
14257,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: But I'm you're squire.
14258,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Do you even know what a squire is?
14259,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: An attendant to a knight?
14260,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
14261,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"podrick: Well, where would I go?"
14262,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,"brienne: I don't care, I'm not your mother."
14263,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: You swore to find the Stark girls.
14264,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
14265,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,podrick: Sansa still might.
14266,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,brienne: Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
14267,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stark,stark: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
14268,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,baelish: I did.
14269,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stark,stark: But we're heading west.

14272,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,"baelish: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
14273,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stark,stark: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
14274,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,"baelish: No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
14275,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stark,stark: So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
14276,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,baelish,"baelish: So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
14277,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"loras: It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
14278,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,loras: But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.

14294,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,lancel: I led you into the darkness.
14295,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

14338,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
14339,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
14340,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
14341,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: I'm not well-suited for work.
14342,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
14343,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
14344,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: I never said you were perfect.
14345,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: What is it you want exactly?
14346,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,varys: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
14347,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,"lannister: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
14348,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
14349,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
14350,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
14351,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: Good luck finding him.
14352,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"varys: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
14353,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lannister,lannister: Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
14354,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,naharis,naharis: When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.

The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."

14358,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: Concessions?
14359,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
14360,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
14361,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
14362,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,"targaryen: I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
14363,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
14364,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
14365,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"hizdahr: In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
14366,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
14367,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: No fighting pits.
14368,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,hizdahr: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
14369,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

14371,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: How many times must I say no before you understand?

14373,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: You should reopen the fighting pits.
14374,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: What?
14375,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
14376,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: Why?
14377,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
14378,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,"targaryen: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
14379,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
14380,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"daario: You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
14381,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
14382,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
14383,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
14384,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,daario: A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
14385,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: Viserion? Rhaegal?
14386,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,targaryen,targaryen: Easy. Easy. Easy.

14393,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,mance: He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
14394,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,snow,snow: Shouldn't a king be bold?

Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"

You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel.

14475,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baelish,"baelish: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."

14575,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,ellaria: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
14576,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"ellaria: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"

14585,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"daario: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
14586,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: Fear is useful that way.

14590,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,targaryen,targaryen: Why?
14591,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: For one thing, he may have valuable information."
14592,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
14593,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,barristan: How do you know that?
14594,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,daario: Because I questioned him.

14597,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,hizdahr: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
14598,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,targaryen,targaryen: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
14599,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,mossador: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.

He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."

14614,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"barristan: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."

14621,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: I want to take a walk.
14622,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
14623,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,"lannister: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
14624,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
14625,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
14626,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: The road to Meereen.
14627,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
14628,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: I told you. A ruler.
14629,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
14630,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
14631,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: I didn't rule. I was a servant.

14633,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: Managed to kill a lot of people.

14637,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
14638,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,varys: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
14639,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: I find us repulsive.
14640,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"varys: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."

14654,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,"lannister: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."

14658,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.

14665,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,"lannister: Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
14666,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
14667,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: The king is very busy at this moment.

I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
14671,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
14672,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: What mission?
14673,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: That is not your concern as Master of War.
14674,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,kevan: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
14675,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lannister,lannister: You would abandon your king in his time of need?

14678,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!

14687,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: Three.

14689,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...

14692,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
14693,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"shireen: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
14694,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,gilly: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
14695,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,sam: Did you ever see them?
14696,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"gilly: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."

14703,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,selyse: She's a wildling.
14704,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
14705,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,selyse: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
14706,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,shireen: Gilly wouldn't do that.
14707,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,selyse: You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
14708,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baratheon,"baratheon: I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
14709,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."

14711,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,snow: No. Only one of their own.

14713,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,snow: The Lord Commander's niece.
14714,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baratheon,"baratheon: Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."

14716,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baratheon,baratheon: That amuses you?
14717,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
14718,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baratheon,baratheon: I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.

14723,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,baratheon,baratheon: Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
14724,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."

14726,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."

14729,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."

14732,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,sam: But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
14733,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,snow,"snow: I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"

14736,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,"janos: Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."

He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too.

14897,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: He hates that nickname.
14898,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
14899,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
14900,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: He borrowed it?
14901,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
14902,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: As punishment. For both of you.
14903,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
14904,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
14905,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
14906,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
14907,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
14908,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: You want to be a knight, Pod?"
14909,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: Yes.
14910,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."

14913,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: I suppose that's more important.
14914,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"podrick: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
14915,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: I was.
14916,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
14917,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,brienne: He was.
14918,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But how did you end up serving Renly?
14919,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
14920,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
14921,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
14922,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,podrick: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
14923,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"brienne: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
14924,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baratheon,baratheon: Lord Commander.
14925,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,snow,snow: Your Grace.

14933,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,snow,"snow: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."

14935,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,snow,snow: I can imagine no higher praise.
14936,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baratheon,"baratheon: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."

14938,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baratheon,baratheon: Are you bored of us already?
14939,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,snow,snow: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
14940,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baratheon,baratheon: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.

Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."

14944,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baratheon,baratheon: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

15042,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"sparrow: High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."

15046,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,sparrow: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15047,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lannister,lannister: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?

15050,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"sparrow: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15051,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lannister,"lannister: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"

15055,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lannister,"lannister: My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."

15077,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose: And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15078,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baelish,"baelish: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15079,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,roose: The Queen will be enraged.
15080,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baelish,"baelish: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."

If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15084,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,baelish,baelish: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.

The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. .

The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost.

15475,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: But you don't know what it is.
15476,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"aemon: That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."

15480,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: Hard to lead when you're in chains.
15481,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: What if I unchained you?
15482,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: Why would you do that?
15483,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
15484,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
15485,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,"snow: For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."

15491,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
15492,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
15493,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
15494,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
15495,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,"snow: And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
15496,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,tormund: Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
15497,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less.

15510,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,man: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
15511,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,allister,allister: We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.

15514,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,"snow: You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
15515,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,"snow: Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
15516,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"olly: You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
15517,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,snow,snow: It's not a trick.
15518,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"olly: They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."

15624,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"roose: She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"

15640,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,gilly: Like Maester Aemon?

We march at sunrise."

15762,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",hghar,hghar: The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?

15774,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
15775,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: Why?
15776,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
15777,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.

15784,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: I only know what I heard

More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."

15795,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."

15800,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,"mormont: Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
15801,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: It's hard to be a cynic after that.

Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
15807,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: Then she rules.

15809,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: She is the rightful heir.
15810,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"

15820,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,malko: Worthless. Cut his throat.

15822,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,malko: And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

15825,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: Guess again.
15826,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,malko: The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

15836,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,malko: Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
15837,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",mormont,mormont: I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
15838,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,malko: Liar.

15856,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
15857,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",baelish,baelish: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
15858,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."

15860,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
15861,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",baelish,baelish: Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
15862,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: Good. If there's nothing else.

15864,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: That's not possible.

15867,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",baelish,baelish: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
15868,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: We were fools to trust a turncloak.
15869,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",baelish,baelish: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
15870,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.

15903,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,bronn: The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...

15941,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
15942,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: Everyone knew about him and Renly.
15943,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
15944,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: But he was the king's brother.
15945,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
15946,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: Cersei is behind this.
15947,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
15948,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
15949,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: You must be exhausted.
15950,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
15951,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
15952,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
15953,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: Beg your pardon.
15954,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
15955,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
15956,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
15957,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
15958,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,"tyrell: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
15959,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
15960,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
15961,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
15962,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: What veil?
15963,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,lannister: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
15964,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
15965,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lannister,"lannister: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
15966,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
15967,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,loras: I don't pay attention to rumors.
15968,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"sparrow: You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in"

15970,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"sparrow: Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
15971,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,loras: I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
15972,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: Wearing Renly's armor.
15973,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,loras: Why does it matter what I wore?
15974,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"sparrow: Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."

15978,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: Nor any other man.
15979,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: That will be all Ser Loras.
15980,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: Well I think that's quite enough of that.
15981,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
15982,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: You call me forward?

15987,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: They are lies.
15988,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: All of them?
15989,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrell,tyrell: All of them.

16005,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"olyvar: He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."

16008,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,sparrow: The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.

But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."

16324,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr: For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
16325,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Move yourselves!
16326,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,owner: Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
16327,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"owner: We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16328,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,"men: We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16329,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,targaryen,targaryen: I think I've seen enough.
16330,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"hizdahr: Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
16331,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,targaryen,targaryen: I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
16332,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: What are you doing?
16333,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,targaryen,targaryen: Get him out of my sight.
16334,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,mormont,"mormont: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
16335,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: It's true. He has.
16336,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,targaryen,targaryen: Who are you?
16337,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,"lannister: I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
16338,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,"lannister: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
16339,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrell,tyrell: I know you did this.
16340,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
16341,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrell,"tyrell: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
16342,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
16343,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrell,tyrell: I don't want to see you again.
16344,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,"lannister: I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
16345,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrell,tyrell: Leave.
16346,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,"lannister: Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
16347,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrell,tyrell: Get out you hateful bitch!
16348,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,"lannister: Sleep well, sister."
16349,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Thank you. You saw her?
16350,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Yes.
16351,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: And?
16352,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
16353,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
16354,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Who will stand judge?
16355,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
16356,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Will you be one of them?
16357,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: I will.
16358,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
16359,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
16360,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: What does The Mother's mercy entail?
16361,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
16362,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
16363,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
16364,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: I think I may have heard at one point.
16365,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
16366,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: Who carved this altar do you know?
16367,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: I'm afraid i don't.
16368,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
16369,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"sparrow: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
16370,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,sparrow: And he has much to say about you.
16371,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Move. Let me go immediately.
16372,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
16373,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,lannister,lannister: Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
16374,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,end,end: EPISODE
16375,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,mormont,"mormont: Your Grace, I want to say--"
16376,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
16377,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: If only I were otherwise.
16378,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
16379,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
16380,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
16381,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
16382,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
16383,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
16384,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
16385,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
16386,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I have a very large army and very large dragons.
16387,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
16388,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
16389,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I know.
16390,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
16391,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
16392,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
16393,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,"targaryen: Yes, many opportunities."
16394,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: And did he?
16395,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: No. Not until forced to do so.
16396,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
16397,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: So I should kill him?
16398,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
16399,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
16400,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Confess.
16401,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: My son. Let me speak to--
16402,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Confess. I meant it.
16403,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: My face will be the last thing you see before--
16404,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
16405,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
16406,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
16407,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
16408,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: How will she serve him?
16409,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
16410,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: What will she do there?
16411,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: She will see.
16412,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: See what?
16413,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,"hghar: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
16414,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Oysters, clams and cockles!"
16415,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
16416,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: Your oysters fresh?
16417,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: Best in the city.
16418,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
16419,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
16420,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
16421,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,man: Can't do it.
16422,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,"man: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
16423,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
16424,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
16425,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: A girl tells a man that she has seen.
16426,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
16427,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,"hghar: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
16428,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
16429,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
16430,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: And then what?
16431,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: A gift for the Thin Man.
16432,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif: She is not ready.
16433,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,"hghar: Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
16434,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,waif: And if she's not?
16435,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,hghar,hghar: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
16436,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
16437,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: The charges?
16438,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
16439,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: All lies.
16440,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
16441,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
16442,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
16443,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Tell him I need to speak to him.
16444,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn: I implored him to visit you but he would not.
16445,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
16446,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
16447,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
16448,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
16449,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I can't stay here.
16450,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"qyburn: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
16451,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
16452,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,qyburn: Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
16453,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: Why. Why Theon.
16454,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
16455,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
16456,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
16457,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
16458,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
16459,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,"greyjoy: They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
16460,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: They weren't. They were only--
16461,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: Only what?
16462,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: I can't..
16463,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: Tell me!

16465,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Tell me, they weren't what?!"
16466,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: They weren't...
16467,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
16468,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
16469,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,stark: You didn't…?
16470,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
16471,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,greyjoy: I can't talk to you anymore.
16472,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,stark,"stark: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
16473,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Not Theon, Reek!"
16474,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bannerman,"bannerman: Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
16475,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,"roose: And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
16476,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: You disagree?
16477,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton,"bolton: Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
16478,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: And what do you recommend?
16479,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton,"bolton: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
16480,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,roose: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
16481,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton,bolton: I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
16482,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
16483,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
16484,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: It's probably my safest option.
16485,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
16486,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: And what would your father do?
16487,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
16488,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Is that why you killed him?
16489,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
16490,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
16491,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
16492,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I'm terrible?
16493,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I've heard stories.
16494,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
16495,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
16496,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Which kind is that?
16497,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
16498,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
16499,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
16500,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Perhaps it won't come to that.
16501,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
16502,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Varys? King Robert's spy master?
16503,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
16504,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
16505,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
16506,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: But you trust him?
16507,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
16508,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: The brother who killed my father.
16509,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: That's the one.
16510,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
16511,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
16512,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not going to kill you.
16513,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: No? Banish me?
16514,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: No.
16515,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
16516,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
16517,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: Advise you on what?
16518,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: How to get what I want.
16519,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
16520,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
16521,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
16522,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
16523,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
16524,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: The common people.
16525,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
16526,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,"targaryen: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
16527,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
16528,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
16529,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,mormont,mormont: You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
16530,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,master: You struck me.
16531,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,mormont,mormont: I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
16532,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,"master: You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
16533,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,mormont,mormont: Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
16534,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,septa: Thirsty? Confess.
16535,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
16536,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,lannister: I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
16537,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lannister,"lannister: I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
16538,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: Does it hurt?
16539,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: No.
16540,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: Good.
16541,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: How are you?
16542,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
16543,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: You know what I mean.
16544,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I'm good.
16545,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Are you scared?
16546,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: A little.
16547,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Me too.
16548,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Who's there?
16549,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: Olly.
16550,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Come in.
16551,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: I heard what happened.
16552,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
16553,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: Figured you were hungry.
16554,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: You're a good lad.
16555,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
16556,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,gilly: I need to check on baby Sam.
16557,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Now then. How can I help?
16558,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: It's about the Lord Commander.
16559,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Yes?
16560,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
16561,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: We've been fighting them for years.
16562,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
16563,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
16564,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,"olly: The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
16565,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Olly...
16566,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: How can he trust him?
16567,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam: I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
16568,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
16569,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"sam: Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
16570,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,olly: You believe that?
16571,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: With all my heart.
16572,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,sam: Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
16573,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: You trust me Jon Snow?
16574,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: Does that make me a fool?
16575,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: We are fools together now.
16576,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
16577,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
16578,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: War.
16579,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
16580,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
16581,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: You don't give the orders here.
16582,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: I'm not giving an order.
16583,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: Why aren't you in chains?
16584,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: He's not my prisoner.
16585,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: What is he?
16586,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: We're allies.
16587,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,bones: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
16588,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: I don't fight for the crows.
16589,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
16590,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bones,"bones: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
16591,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,tormund: Gather the elders and let's talk.
16592,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
16593,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: You built that wall to keep us out.
16594,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
16595,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
16596,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"karsi: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
16597,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
16598,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
16599,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: You saw this?
16600,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: No. But I trust the man.
16601,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: There are old stories about Dragonglass.
16602,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
16603,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
16604,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
16605,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: Come with you where?
16606,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
16607,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,"snow: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
16608,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,karsi: If…?
16609,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
16610,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: Where is Mance?
16611,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: He died.
16612,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: How?
16613,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,snow,snow: I put an arrow through his heart.
16614,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,loboda: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.

16767,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
16768,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
16769,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."

16773,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
16774,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker: Most unfortunate for the glovers.
16775,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."

16777,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,mace: You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
16778,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker: I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
16779,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
16780,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,banker: I don't have that gift.
16781,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"mace: It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"

16810,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hghar,hghar: Perhaps that's why the man is thin.
16811,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stark,stark: Tomorrow.

16819,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria: Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home

16823,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria: I wasn't talking about her.
16824,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"ellaria: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
16825,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,ellaria: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.

16829,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,baratheon,baratheon: What's it about?
16830,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"shireen: It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
16831,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,baratheon,baratheon: The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
16832,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen: That's just what they call it.
16833,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,baratheon,baratheon: Doesn't make much sense.
16834,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen: I think it's poetic.
16835,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,baratheon,"baratheon: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
16836,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,shireen: I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
16837,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,baratheon,"baratheon: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."

They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.

16915,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,"soldier: Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."

16917,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,baratheon,baratheon: Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.

16923,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,snow: I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
16924,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: But… the Dragonglass?
16925,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,"snow: No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."

16927,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,snow: With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
16928,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
16929,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,snow: Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
16930,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
16931,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,snow: Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
16932,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,snow: What?
16933,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"sam: I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
16934,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,snow,"snow: I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"

16936,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"sam: I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
16937,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"sam: If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
16938,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,sam: Thank you.

Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"

The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances?

18190,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,lannister: It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
18191,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: You don't like Margaery, do you?"
18192,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."

18196,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."

18201,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,lannister: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
18202,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,olenna,"olenna: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"

18204,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."

18209,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"

18211,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,"lannister: The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
18212,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,lannister: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
18213,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,kevan: Of course I want him back.
18214,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lannister,lannister: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.

18413,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,crane,crane: It's only a matter of time.
18414,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,crane,crane: To our children.

18416,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,crane,crane: And your filthy mind.
18417,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
18418,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
18419,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: A girl is not ready.
18420,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: She's a good actress.
18421,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: So a man has heard.
18422,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: Seems like a decent woman.
18423,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
18424,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: No. Who wants her dead?
18425,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: That does not matter. The price was paid.
18426,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
18427,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
18428,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: A girl has decided.
18429,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hghar,hghar: A servant does not ask questions.

18431,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: It was you. You made the White Walkers.
18432,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,leaf: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
18433,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: From whom?
18434,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,leaf: From you. From men.
18435,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
18436,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
18437,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,man: We've never had a queen. Not once.
18438,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
18439,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,all: Aye!
18440,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: We are a sea people.

18447,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
18448,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: She is a reaver!
18449,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: She is a warrior!
18450,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: She is ironborn!

18455,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Nephew. Little Theon.
18456,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
18457,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Explains why you think a woman can be king.
18458,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: When did you return, Uncle?"
18459,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
18460,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
18461,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
18462,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
18463,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
18464,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
18465,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
18466,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: And how will she do that?
18467,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
18468,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
18469,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
18470,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
18471,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"aeron: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
18472,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aerson,aerson: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
18473,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
18474,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"aeron: What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
18475,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: What is dead may never die.

18477,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
18478,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,aeron: They stole our best ships.
18479,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Won't be enough to save them.
18480,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,greyjoy,greyjoy: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
18481,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,targaryen: I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
18482,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,mormont,mormont: You must send me away.
18483,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,targaryen: Is there a cure?
18484,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,mormont,mormont: I don't know.
18485,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,targaryen: How long does it take?
18486,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,mormont,mormont: I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
18487,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,targaryen: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
18488,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,mormont,"mormont: Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
18489,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,"targaryen: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
18490,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,targaryen: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
18491,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,targaryen,"targaryen: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
18492,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
18493,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,worm,worm: None.
18494,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
18495,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,worm,"worm: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
18496,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
18497,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,worm,worm: For now.
18498,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: For now is the best we get in our profession.
18499,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: It's not enough.
18500,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
18501,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,"lannister: It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
18502,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,missandei,missandei: The people know who brought them freedom.
18503,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,"lannister: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
18504,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
18505,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: Who said anything about “him”?
18506,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"man: You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
18507,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: Welcome to Meereen.
18508,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
18509,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
18510,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
18511,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
18512,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
18513,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: Yes.
18514,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
18515,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: She did indeed.
18516,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
18517,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
18518,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."

18520,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
18521,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: That sounds most excellent --
18522,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
18523,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,lannister: We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
18524,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,varys: I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
18525,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
18526,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"varys: And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
18527,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lannister,"lannister: My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
18528,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"kinvara: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
18529,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,kinvara: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?

They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
18555,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,snow,"snow: There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
18556,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,"stark: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
18557,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,davos: I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
18558,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,"stark: No, but I do."
18559,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,"stark: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
18560,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,davos: I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
18561,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
18562,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,snow,snow: How do you know that?
18563,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
18564,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"davos: That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."

18566,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
18567,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: We can send the Blackfish a raven.
18568,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
18569,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
18570,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: What is it?
18571,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: I don't like leaving you here alone.
18572,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: With Jon?
18573,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"brienne: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
18574,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,"stark: Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
18575,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,brienne: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
18576,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,snow,snow: New dress?
18577,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: I made it myself. Do you like it?
18578,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,snow,"snow: Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
18579,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,"stark: Good, because I made this for you."
18580,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,stark,stark: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
18581,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,snow,"snow: Thank you, Sansa."

18628,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
18629,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
18630,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: That's not any better being a nervous mute.
18631,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
18632,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam: And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
18633,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: That Little Sam is your baby.
18634,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
18635,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: What did you tell your family about me?
18636,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,sam: I told them I met you in the North.
18637,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: Did you tell them how far north?
18638,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
18639,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
18640,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
18641,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: I think we're here.

18658,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,melessa: They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.

18662,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
18663,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow: She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
18664,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
18665,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,sparrow: And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
18666,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?

18676,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tyrell,tyrell: He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
18677,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
18678,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
18679,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tyrell,"tyrell: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
18680,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: I don't understand.
18681,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tyrell,tyrell: It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
18682,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lannister,lannister: What about Loras?
18683,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tyrell,"tyrell: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
18684,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,gilly: It's hard to walk in this.

18686,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"

18690,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Oh, that's a fair distance."
18691,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon: So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
18692,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
18693,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,dickon: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
18694,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"sam: Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
18695,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"melessa: I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
18696,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,talla: Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."

Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."

18934,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,"tyrell: Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
18935,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"sparrow: You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
18936,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,"tyrell: For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."

18990,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,tyrell: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
18991,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
18992,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,tyrell: Good.
18993,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
18994,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,"tyrell: I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
18995,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
18996,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,"tyrell: I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
18997,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: Never. I'll never leave my son.
18998,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tyrell,"tyrell: What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
18999,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man: Pick the pace up. Keep going.
19000,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,man: Keep it moving!
19001,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19002,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: Someone certainly does.
19003,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
19004,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
19005,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"bronn: Aye, knights don't get paid."
19006,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19007,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19008,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19009,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19010,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19011,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
19012,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,"lothar: Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him."
19013,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,lothar: This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
19014,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,walder,"walder: You think I won't do it, old man?"
19015,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,walder,walder: I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19016,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: Go on, then. Cut his throat."
19017,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: Lothar, is it?"
19018,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,lothar: Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
19019,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19020,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
19021,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

19023,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,lothar: Walder.
19024,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,walder,walder: Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
19025,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
19026,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,walder,walder: I don't give a rat's- -
19027,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.

19029,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,lothar: Do as he says.
19030,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
19031,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19032,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,walder,walder: Those are our siege towers- -
19033,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
19034,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19035,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: A parley or a fight?
19036,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: He's an old man.
19037,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,bronn: You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
19038,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: Lady Mormont.

19040,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,stark,"stark: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
19041,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19042,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,"snow: I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19043,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
19044,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19045,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19046,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,"snow: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
19047,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
19048,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,stark,"stark: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19049,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19050,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,"snow: Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19051,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
19052,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
19053,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: I don't know you, Ser…?"

19055,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,davos: You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
19056,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19057,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
19058,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: Go on, Ser Davos."
19059,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19060,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,lyanna: Is this true?
19061,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19062,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"davos: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19063,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."

19066,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: 62?
19067,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"lyanna: We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."

19071,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.

19073,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19074,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Then why are you here?
19075,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"

19078,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19079,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19080,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19081,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,brynden: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19082,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,"lannister: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19083,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19084,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lannister,lannister: You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19085,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"brynden: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."

19090,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19091,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -

19097,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19098,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19099,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: Lord Glover.

19102,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"robett: Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
19103,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,robett: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19104,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"robett: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."

19139,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,stark,stark: So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19140,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,snow,snow: Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19141,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,stark,"stark: Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"

Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."

That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
19155,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: It's never too late to come back.
19156,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,ray: And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.

But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."

19195,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crane,crane: I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.

19283,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
19284,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: Not yet.
19285,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Are they in there?
19286,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: Mm-hmm.
19287,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: You think they're fucking?
19288,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: What? No.
19289,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
19290,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: I'm her squire.
19291,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
19292,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: You must have shown it to her by now.
19293,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: She's training me to fight.
19294,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Is she? Oh.
19295,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
19296,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
19297,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"podrick: Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
19298,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
19299,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: All right, let's start with your footwork."
19300,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,bronn: Show me your stance.
19301,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
19302,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"bronn: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
19303,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
19304,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Why would you assume that?
19305,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
19306,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I don't think you know many girls like her.
19307,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
19308,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
19309,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I've come for the Blackfish.
19310,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: You're welcome to have him.
19311,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
19312,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
19313,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: The Tully army.
19314,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
19315,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
19316,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
19317,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
19318,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Exactly.
19319,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: We shouldn't argue about politics.
19320,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
19321,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
19322,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
19323,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: What do you propose?
19324,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
19325,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
19326,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
19327,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Have you ever met the Blackfish?
19328,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: No.
19329,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: He's even more stubborn than you are.
19330,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
19331,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
19332,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: You have my word. You have until nightfall.
19333,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
19334,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: It's yours. It will always be yours.
19335,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: one last thing, Ser Jaime."
19336,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Yes, Lady Brienne?"
19337,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
19338,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Of course it does.
19339,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: To fight you.
19340,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
19341,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I've said no three times already.
19342,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
19343,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
19344,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: Double the guards tonight.
19345,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bryndel,bryndel: The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
19346,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: As I have said, my name is- -"
19347,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
19348,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: He always spoke highly of you.
19349,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
19350,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
19351,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
19352,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
19353,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: He's not my friend.
19354,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: No?
19355,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
19356,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"brienne: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
19357,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: She's exactly like her mother.
19358,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,brynden: I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
19359,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: You have more than she does.
19360,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"brynden: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
19361,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
19362,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,podrick: What should I write?
19363,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,brienne: Tell her I failed.
19364,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: There's to be a royal announcement?
19365,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: There is.
19366,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Why wasn't I informed?
19367,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
19368,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: Where are you going?
19369,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: To stand by my son.
19370,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,kevan: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
19371,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
19372,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
19373,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crowd,crowd: Seven blessings.
19374,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
19375,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
19376,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,qyburn: More. Much more.
19377,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: You seem happy.
19378,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
19379,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Now it's like a man reborn.
19380,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I will be happy when our queen returns.
19381,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
19382,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,worm,worm: Unsullied never drink.
19383,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Why not?
19384,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,worm,worm: Rules.
19385,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: And who made these rules? Your former masters?
19386,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
19387,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: And you? What's your excuse?
19388,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
19389,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: That's how you know it's working.
19390,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
19391,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."

19393,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Do you like it?
19394,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,worm,worm: Tastes like it has turned.
19395,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
19396,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
19397,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,missandei: I do not know any jokes.
19398,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Grey worm?
19399,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
19400,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
19401,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: It's funnier in Westeros.
19402,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,worm,"worm: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
19403,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: Yes.
19404,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"missandei: A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
19405,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."

19433,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure: Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
19434,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"edmure: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
19435,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,lannister: I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
19436,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,edmure: Yeah. She should have killed you.
19437,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."

19444,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."

19449,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lannister,"lannister: And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."

19496,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Any particular reason?
19497,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
19498,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.

19500,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Not anymore. They're mine.

19515,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
19516,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Bunch of nancies.
19517,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.

19524,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: You ought to join us. We could use you.
19525,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
19526,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"thoros: Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
19527,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
19528,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: Cold winds are rising in the North.
19529,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,sandor: And you're going to go stop them?
19530,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: We need good men to help us.
19531,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
19532,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,beric: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
19533,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"sandor: I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
19534,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,"beric: Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."

19539,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
19540,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,waif: Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.

19547,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,targaryen: The city is on the rise?
19548,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,lannister: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
19549,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
19550,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,lannister: it proves that no one needs a Master.
19551,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,targaryen: Good. Shall we begin?
19552,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,lannister: Do we have a plan?
19553,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,"targaryen: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
19554,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,targaryen: You don't approve?
19555,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,lannister: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
19556,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
19557,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,targaryen: This is entirely different.
19558,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,lannister: You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
19559,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"razdal: Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
19560,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
19561,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,yezzan: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
19562,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,targaryen,"targaryen: We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."

Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
19580,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
19581,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,bolton,"bolton: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
19582,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
19583,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,bolton,"bolton: He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
19584,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: How do we know you have him?
19585,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,bolton,"bolton: Now, if you want to save —"

My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
19588,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
19589,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
19590,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
19591,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
19592,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
19593,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
19594,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: stares blankly at JON SNOW.
19595,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: A pincer move.
19596,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
19597,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: Good.
19598,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
19599,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
19600,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
19601,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: We should all get some sleep.
19602,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
19603,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
19604,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Aye, for what they're worth."
19605,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
19606,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: You're right.
19607,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
19608,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: He's overconfident.
19609,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
19610,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
19611,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: You don't know him.
19612,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
19613,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
19614,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: We can't give up on our brother.
19615,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
19616,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: Of course he does. What should I do differently?
19617,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
19618,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Aye, that's good advice."
19619,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: You think that's obvious?
19620,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Well, it is a bit obvious."
19621,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
19622,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
19623,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,stark: It's not enough!
19624,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
19625,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,stark,"stark: If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"

19628,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: You think there's hope?
19629,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
19630,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
19631,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: You saw these demons?
19632,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: What?
19633,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
19634,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"tormund: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
19635,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
19636,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: Jon Snow's not a king.
19637,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, he's not."
19638,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
19639,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"davos: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
19640,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,tormund: So what do you do all night?
19641,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,davos: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

19645,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: Any advice?
19646,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: Don't lose.
19647,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,"snow: If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
19648,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: I'll have to try.
19649,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

19653,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: How do you know what he commands?
19654,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"melisandre: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
19655,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: Why?
19656,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
19657,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,snow,snow: What kind of god would do something like that?
19658,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,melisandre: The one we've got.
19659,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
19660,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,greyjoy,greyjoy: It was a long time ago.
19661,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
19662,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,greyjoy,greyjoy: I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
19663,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,greyjoy,greyjoy: And he paid for them.
19664,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,lannister,"lannister: Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"

19745,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"sparrow: The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."

19748,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,loras: I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.

19768,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"qyburn: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."

Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."

19783,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lannister,"lannister: Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."

20004,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,frey,"frey: Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
20005,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,frey,"frey: I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"

20009,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,"walder: Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
20010,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,"walder: Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."

20019,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
20020,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,robett,robett: It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
20021,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Not just the boys.
20022,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
20023,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,robett,robett: You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
20024,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,"lyanna: I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."

20026,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,lyanna: And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
20027,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,"lyanna: We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
20028,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
20029,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: But if we're going to survive this winter together...
20030,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,tormund: You want us to man the castles for you?
20031,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

20033,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
20034,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,yohn,yohn: The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
20035,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
20036,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,all,all: Aye!
20037,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
20038,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: And then they broke faith.
20039,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
20040,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
20041,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
20042,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
20043,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
20044,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Ned Umber.

20048,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"

20052,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20053,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: So I can't question your decisions anymore?
20054,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: Of course you can, but--"
20055,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20056,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Do you think I'm Joffrey?
20057,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
20058,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Thank you.
20059,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You're good at this, you know."
20060,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: At what?
20061,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: At ruling.
20062,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: No.
20063,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
20064,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: Why are you laughing?
20065,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
20066,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: He never said that to me.
20067,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20068,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20069,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20070,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: I'm not trying to undermine you.
20071,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20072,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20073,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: Would that be so terrible?

20077,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20078,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20079,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,"snow: I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20080,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20081,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20082,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20083,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,snow,snow: You almost sound as if you admire her.
20084,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: I learned a great deal from her.
20085,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: What is this?
20086,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20087,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20088,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: It's ours now, we just have to take it."
20089,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20090,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: No, not angry."
20091,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Are you afraid of me?
20092,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Should I be?

Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"

20095,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20096,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Enemies to the east.
20097,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

20099,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20100,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20101,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20102,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."

20105,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20106,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.

20113,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."

20115,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20116,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."

20123,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20124,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."

Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."

Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20130,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20131,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,"lannister: The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20132,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."

20135,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20136,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,"greyjoy: A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20137,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: If not the most humble.
20138,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,"greyjoy: You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20139,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: What do you want in return?
20140,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20141,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: I decline your proposal.
20142,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,greyjoy: Why?
20143,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lannister,lannister: You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20144,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,greyjoy: You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20145,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20146,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20147,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Weigh that.
20148,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
20149,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20150,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: What's the weight?
20151,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Um, 147."
20152,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20153,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: I don't remember your proposition.
20154,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20155,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20156,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: No.
20157,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20158,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20159,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20160,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: Sources in the restricted area?
20161,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20162,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"sam: So, you believe me."
20163,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20164,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20165,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"marwyn: We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20166,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,marwyn: Be a good lad. Clean this up.
20167,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: Nope.
20168,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,tormund: You're a lucky man.
20169,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
20170,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
20171,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20172,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20173,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20174,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: At the moment, peace and quiet."
20175,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
20176,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,petyr: My lady.
20177,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: Why is he still here?
20178,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20179,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,brienne: He wants something.
20180,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: I know exactly what he wants.
20181,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20182,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
20183,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: It's a new one.
20184,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
20185,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: I don't want to steal your food.
20186,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
20187,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: You heading south?
20188,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: King's Landing.
20189,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Poor girl.
20190,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: Not so bad, is it?"
20191,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20192,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20193,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
20194,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Worst place in the world.
20195,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: What are you doing in the Riverlands?
20196,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."

20198,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
20199,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
20200,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,"stark: You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
20201,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
20202,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: 3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
20203,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
20204,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: My wife's just had our first baby.
20205,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: Boy or girl?
20206,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
20207,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: I hope it's a girl.
20208,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: Why?
20209,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
20210,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: Are you old enough to drink?
20211,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,man: It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
20212,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: It's really good.
20213,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"man: So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
20214,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,stark,stark: I'm going to kill the queen.
20215,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Bad night to be outdoors.
20216,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20217,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros: You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20218,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

20220,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: Experience.
20221,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: This seems like a good place to spend the night.
20222,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: These people don't want us here.
20223,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20224,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: I don't like the look of it.
20225,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"thoros: For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20226,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20227,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20228,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: They don't.
20229,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,thoros: See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20230,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: How do you think it ended for them?
20231,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: With death.
20232,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric: Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."

20234,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"beric: No, doesn't matter now."

20236,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
20237,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
20238,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."

20240,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,sandor: But there's nothing special about you.
20241,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: You're right about that.
20242,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
20243,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?

20247,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
20248,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"sandor: If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"

20252,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,beric: Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.

20280,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,sam: It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
20281,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,gilly: That's dragonglass?

20288,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: On a night like this, you came into the world."
20289,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
20290,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: I wish I could remember it.
20291,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
20292,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
20293,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Good.
20294,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Not so many lions.
20295,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
20296,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
20297,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
20298,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
20299,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
20300,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: No.
20301,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
20302,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: I never properly thanked you for that.
20303,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
20304,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
20305,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I did.
20306,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: And then you served the man who overthrew him?
20307,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
20308,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
20309,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
20310,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
20311,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
20312,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
20313,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
20314,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
20315,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: Which you turned to your advantage.
20316,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Who gave the order to kill me?
20317,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: King Robert.
20318,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Who hired the assassins?
20319,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
20320,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
20321,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: To keep yourself alive.
20322,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
20323,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
20324,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
20325,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
20326,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: I swear it, my queen."
20327,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
20328,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,varys: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
20329,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,"worm: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
20330,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
20331,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
20332,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: I am called Melisandre.
20333,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
20334,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: No, it didn't."
20335,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
20336,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
20337,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
20338,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
20339,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: What does your Lord expect from me?
20340,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
20341,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
20342,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,"missandei: Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
20343,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
20344,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: No, but I like it better."
20345,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
20346,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
20347,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
20348,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: You know him?
20349,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
20350,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"varys: And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
20351,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,melisandre: As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
20352,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: He sounds like quite a man.
20353,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"melisandre: Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
20354,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
20355,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
20356,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
20357,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
20358,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: Read the last bit.
20359,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,"stark: All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
20360,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
20361,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,"stark: Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
20362,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
20363,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: What?
20364,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
20365,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
20366,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: No, too dangerous."
20367,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: But?
20368,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"davos: But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
20369,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
20370,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
20371,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
20372,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"randyll: She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?"
20373,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
20374,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Lord Tarley.
20375,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"randyll: Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son."

20377,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: Rickon, isn't it?"
20378,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,dickon,dickon: Dickon.
20379,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: That's it.
20380,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
20381,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"randyll: If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
20382,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Do you ride for Hornhill today?
20383,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll: I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
20384,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
20385,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"randyll: It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
20386,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
20387,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll: Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
20388,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
20389,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,randyll: I've known Olenna since I was a child.
20390,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
20391,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
20392,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
20393,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,mormont,mormont: How long?
20394,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."

20396,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer."

20399,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: No.
20400,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
20401,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
20402,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
20403,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: Come, Samwell."

20411,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
20412,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
20413,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"qyburn: Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."

20419,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
20420,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.

20422,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrell,"tyrell: That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
20423,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
20424,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrell,tyrell: Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
20425,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
20426,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
20427,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,"lannister: Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
20428,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,ellia: And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
20429,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: You are.
20430,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
20431,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
20432,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrell,"tyrell: So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
20433,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lannister,lannister: The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
20434,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: Do I have your support?
20435,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,greyjoy,greyjoy: You have mine.
20436,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,"ellia: Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
20437,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,"targaryen: Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
20438,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,targaryen,targaryen: I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
20439,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrell,"tyrell: Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
20440,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrell,"tyrell: He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."

20444,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: But you don't know when that will be.

20448,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,worm: It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
20449,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: Why?
20450,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,worm: You know why.
20451,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I don't.

20453,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: That's what I am? Your weakness?
20454,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,"worm: When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
20455,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I believe it.
20456,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,worm: Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
20457,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I do too.
20458,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,worm,worm: No.
20459,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,missandei: I want to see you. Please.
20460,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.

20462,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: And this one.
20463,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
20464,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: I wanted to ask you --
20465,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
20466,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
20467,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: Possibly something a bit more poetic?
20468,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"marwyn: We're not poets, Tarley."
20469,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,"tarly: Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
20470,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: This is your moment. Use it wisely.
20471,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
20472,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
20473,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,"tarly: Oh, you are?"
20474,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
20475,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: Oh.
20476,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,marwyn: The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
20477,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: Hello.
20478,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,mormont,mormont: What are you doing?
20479,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
20480,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,"tarly: My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."

20484,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,tarly: If you could take off your shirt.
20485,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,"tarly: If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."

20487,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tarly,"tarly: No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"

20490,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
20491,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,"man: If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."

20493,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,man: One more round. It's a long ride.
20494,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: Ary!

20496,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Mmm. This is good.
20497,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
20498,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: I didn't do that.
20499,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: You've been making pies?
20500,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: One or two.
20501,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?

20503,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
20504,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: She found me.
20505,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: What happened to you Ary?
20506,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: You got any ale?

20508,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: King's Landing.
20509,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: Why?
20510,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: I heard Cersei's queen now.
20511,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
20512,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Hmm.
20513,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: I can't believe someone could do that.
20514,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Cersei would do that.
20515,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
20516,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
20517,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: No. The Boltons are dead.
20518,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: What?
20519,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.

20522,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Thanks for the pie.
20523,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,pie,pie: Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
20524,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Thanks.

20529,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
20530,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
20531,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,"snow: He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."

20533,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,"snow: We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
20534,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,"snow: But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
20535,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
20536,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: I know that.
20537,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,"stark: She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."

20539,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,royce,"royce: Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."

It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
20543,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
20544,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
20545,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
20546,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: I'm leaving both in good hands.
20547,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Whose?
20548,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,"snow: Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
20549,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,baelish,baelish: I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
20550,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,baelish,"baelish: I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
20551,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: You don't belong down here.
20552,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,baelish,baelish: Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
20553,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,snow,snow: I have nothing to say to you.
20554,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,baelish,"baelish: Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."

20556,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,stark,stark: Nymeria?

20572,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: Could we get some more?
20573,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,greyjoy,greyjoy: I thought it wasn't for you.
20574,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: I'm developing a taste for it.

20585,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,ellaria: hold that person back.

20612,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.

20617,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: A sham marriage and unconsummated.
20618,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I didn't ask --
20619,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
20620,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: She's starting to let on.
20621,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
20622,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
20623,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
20624,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
20625,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
20626,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: True. But I'm not a Stark.
20627,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."

20629,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
20630,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
20631,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
20632,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
20633,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
20634,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"melisandre: Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
20635,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Why?
20636,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
20637,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: So where will you go?
20638,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,melisandre: Volantis.
20639,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."

20644,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,davos: This is Jon Snow.

20650,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."

I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"

20653,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"

20655,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."

20657,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
20658,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
20659,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
20660,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
20661,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Then why are you here?
20662,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Because I need your help and you need mine.
20663,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
20664,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I did.
20665,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"

20668,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."

20670,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
20671,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
20672,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,"snow: Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."

20681,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Is that another figure of speech?

I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
20690,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.

20695,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
20696,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"davos: All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"

20700,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
20701,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
20702,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: And why would I do that?
20703,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,"snow: I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
20704,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
20705,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
20706,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Am I your prisoner?
20707,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Not yet.
20708,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
20709,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: And?
20710,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
20711,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: All of them?
20712,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: Your sister's dead?
20713,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: Euron has her.
20714,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: You saw him take her? And you got away?
20715,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: I couldn't save her. I tried.
20716,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,captain: You wouldn't be here if you tried.
20717,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
20718,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
20719,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: Oh no!
20720,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: What a twat.
20721,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
20722,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: I give you --
20723,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
20724,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
20725,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: A bit more than a true friend.
20726,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
20727,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: There's only one reward I want.
20728,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: You shall have what your heart desires --
20729,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: when the war is won.
20730,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
20731,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,"greyjoy: There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
20732,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
20733,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
20734,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Advice?
20735,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,greyjoy: Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
20736,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,greyjoy,"greyjoy: Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
20737,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
20738,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
20739,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It doesn't matter now.
20740,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
20741,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I imagine she is your favorite.
20742,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
20743,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
20744,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
20745,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
20746,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
20747,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
20748,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyene,tyene: Momma!
20749,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
20750,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,qyburn: The Long Farewell.
20751,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: That's the one.
20752,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: How long does the poison take?
20753,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"qyburn: Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
20754,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: But death is certain?
20755,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"qyburn: Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
20756,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
20757,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
20758,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: No.
20759,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Don't.
20760,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
20761,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
20762,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"messenger: Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
20763,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
20764,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"messenger: At once, Your Grace."
20765,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: No, thank you."
20766,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
20767,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
20768,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
20769,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
20770,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
20771,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
20772,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
20773,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
20774,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
20775,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
20776,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
20777,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20778,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20779,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
20780,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
20781,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
20782,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"tycho: The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
20783,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
20784,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
20785,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,tycho: Your father's daughter indeed.
20786,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
20787,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
20788,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I'm a prisoner on this island.
20789,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
20790,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Except to my ship. They took my ship.
20791,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I wouldn't say we took your ship.
20792,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
20793,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
20794,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
20795,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: You probably don't believe me.
20796,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I do actually.
20797,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
20798,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
20799,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
20800,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Good question.
20801,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
20802,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
20803,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
20804,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
20805,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,"snow: Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
20806,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
20807,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
20808,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: What do you mean?
20809,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
20810,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Dragonglass?
20811,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
20812,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
20813,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
20814,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
20815,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
20816,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
20817,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
20818,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Which wise man said this?
20819,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I don't remember.
20820,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
20821,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
20822,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
20823,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
20824,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Amazing thing to see.
20825,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
20826,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: You lost two brothers as well?
20827,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
20828,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: You've been talking to Tyrion?
20829,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: He is my Hand.
20830,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: He enjoys talking.
20831,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: We all enjoy what we're good at.
20832,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I don't.
20833,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
20834,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I never expected that you would.
20835,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
20836,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: I haven't either.
20837,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
20838,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: Thank you.
20839,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,snow,snow: So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
20840,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: You better get to work, Jon Snow."
20841,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: How much do we have?
20842,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan: 4,000 bushels, My Lady."
20843,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: What does that mean?
20844,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
20845,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
20846,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,wolkan: I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
20847,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
20848,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"wolkan: No, My Lady, most likely not."
20849,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
20850,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: Very wise, My Lady."
20851,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
20852,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
20853,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: No, My Lady."
20854,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
20855,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
20856,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"yohn: You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
20857,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,baelish,baelish: Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
20858,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: So they should be.
20859,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,baelish,baelish: I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
20860,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
20861,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,baelish,baelish: I only meant to say --
20862,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
20863,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,baelish,"baelish: One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
20864,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,baelish,"baelish: Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
20865,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,guard,"guard: Lady Sansa, at the gate."
20866,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: Hello, Sansa."
20867,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I wish Jon was here.
20868,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: Yes. I need to speak to him.
20869,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
20870,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
20871,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I don't know what that means.
20872,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: It's difficult to explain.
20873,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: Try, please, for me."
20874,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
20875,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: How do you know all of this?
20876,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: The three-eyed raven taught me.
20877,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
20878,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I told you it's difficult to explain.
20879,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: Bran --
20880,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
20881,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,"stark: I have to go back inside, Bran."
20882,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,stark,stark: I'll stay a bit longer.
20883,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Hmm.
20884,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Hmm. Does it hurt?
20885,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: A bit. Less than before.
20886,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: The infection no longer appears to be active.
20887,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
20888,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
20889,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: And the climate.
20890,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
20891,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
20892,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: How bad is it?
20893,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: I suppose I'll find out this evening.
20894,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: Where will you go?
20895,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
20896,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: I owe my life to her and you.
20897,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
20898,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,mormont,mormont: Perhaps our paths will cross again?
20899,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: I hope they do.
20900,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: You treated him?
20901,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: Yes.
20902,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Who told you to treat him?
20903,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: No one.
20904,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
20905,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: I seem to remember you.
20906,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: But you treated him anyway?
20907,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: I did.
20908,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"marwyn: I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
20909,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,tarly: I read the books and followed the instructions.
20910,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
20911,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tarly,"tarly: Thank you, Archmaester."
20912,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: Come here.
20913,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
20914,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,marwyn: You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
20915,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
20916,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"varys: Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
20917,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
20918,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
20919,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,"targaryen: I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
20920,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
20921,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It's too great a risk. You're too important.
20922,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,targaryen,targaryen: What about Casterly Rock?
20923,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: The Unsullied will be there soon.
20924,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,missandei: And what will they face?
20925,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,varys: A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
20926,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
20927,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: No one has ever taken the rock.
20928,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
20929,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: They will be ready.
20930,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,man,man: Draw! Loose!
20931,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
20932,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
20933,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
20934,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
20935,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
20936,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
20937,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
20938,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
20939,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,unsullied,unsullied: There are none left.
20940,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,worm,worm: There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
20941,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,worm,worm: Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
20942,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: It's done?
20943,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: It is.
20944,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
20945,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I suppose as well as can be expected.
20946,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
20947,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
20948,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: So you'll just let them take it?
20949,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
20950,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,"tyrell: And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
20951,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
20952,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: Yes. You must be very wise by now.
20953,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: My father always said I was a slow learner.
20954,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,"tyrell: If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
20955,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,"tyrell: That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
20956,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Widow's Wail.
20957,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,"tyrell: He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
20958,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
20959,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
20960,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
20961,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
20962,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,"lannister: Yes, it has."
20963,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
20964,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: I think we're done here.
20965,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: How will it happen?
20966,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
20967,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: Will there be pain?
20968,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,lannister,lannister: No. I made sure of that.
20969,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,tyrell: That's good.
20970,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrell,"tyrell: I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."

20985,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: I beg to differ.
20986,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
20987,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn: Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"

20990,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: Right. Just not to me.
20991,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.

20992,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"bronn: Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."

20994,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: Like what?

20996,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"randyll: The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."

20998,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon: We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.

21000,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21001,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,bronn: I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21002,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21003,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,randyll: My Lord.
21004,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,dickon: My Lord.

21007,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21008,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: You're too kind, My Lord."
21009,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
21010,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21011,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21012,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21013,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21014,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21015,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21016,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,"lannister: It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21017,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,tycho: I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21018,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21019,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"tycho: Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."

21023,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,baelish,"baelish: The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21024,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,"stark: reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
21025,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,baelish,"baelish: The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21026,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Do you know who this belonged to?
21027,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,baelish,"baelish: No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21028,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,baelish,baelish: hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
21029,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,baelish,"baelish: To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21030,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Chaos is a ladder.
21031,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.

21038,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21039,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera: It's a very good idea.
21040,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: You're leaving?

21047,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera: My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
21048,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,"stark: I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."

21050,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,meera: You died in that cave.
21051,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,"meera: turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."

21063,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off."
21064,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,man: Mm-hmm.
21065,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21066,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
21067,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Which Lady Stark?

21080,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,man: We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
21081,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: sighs.
21082,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."

21084,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"man: Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."

21094,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,"stark: It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
21095,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,"stark: He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
21096,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21097,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Everyone who knew his face is dead.
21098,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: We're not.

21102,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
21103,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Your list?
21104,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Of people I'm going to kill.

21121,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: So did I.

21134,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Why would he give you a dagger?
21135,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: He thought I'd want it.
21136,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Why?
21137,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Because it was meant to kill me.
21138,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: The cutthroat after your fall?
21139,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21140,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21141,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
21142,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: It doesn't matter.
21143,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: What do you mean it doesn't matter?
21144,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: I don't want it.

21146,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
21147,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: It's wasted on a cripple.
21148,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
21149,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.

21155,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"brienne: Thank you, Podrick."
21156,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
21157,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"missandei: Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
21158,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Soon. They will come back to me.
21159,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei: He better.

21161,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: What happened?

21163,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei: Many things.
21164,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Many things?
21165,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: Your Grace.
21166,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
21167,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: It's all right.
21168,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
21169,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
21170,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
21171,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: So this is it, all we'll ever need."
21172,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
21173,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
21174,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
21175,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: The Children of the Forest made these.
21176,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: When?
21177,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: A very long time ago.
21178,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
21179,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: No.
21180,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
21181,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: They were here together the Children and the First Men.
21182,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Doing what? Fighting each other?

21184,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,"targaryen: They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21185,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
21186,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
21187,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: turns to look at JON.
21188,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21189,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: No, I don't think I can."
21190,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: steps forward closer to JON.
21191,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21192,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21193,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
21194,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21195,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
21196,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: What is it?
21197,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: We took Casterly Rock.
21198,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: That's very good to hear.
21199,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
21200,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Isn't it?
21201,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,davos: You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
21202,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21203,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: We still have the largest army.
21204,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21205,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
21206,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,"targaryen: stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
21207,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,"targaryen: The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21208,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: If I've underestimated our enemies --
21209,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,"targaryen: Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21210,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
21211,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: Enough with the clever plans.
21212,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: turns back and looks at TYRION.
21213,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21214,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: We've discussed this.
21215,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21216,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: A smart one.
21217,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: looks over to JON SNOW.
21218,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: What do you think I should do?
21219,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: I would never presume to --
21220,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: I'm at war. I'm losing.
21221,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: begins walking close to JON.
21222,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
21223,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21224,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: glances back towards the dragons.
21225,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
21226,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,targaryen,targaryen: looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
21227,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
21228,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Don't lunge.
21229,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,podrick: pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
21230,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Don't go where your enemy leads you.
21231,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
21232,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Up.
21233,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
21234,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: And don't --
21235,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
21236,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,podrick: stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
21237,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
21238,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
21239,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
21240,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --

21242,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: It's been awhile since I've trained.
21243,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"brienne: I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21244,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
21245,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: chuckles.
21246,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,"stark: You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21247,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: nods her head in agreement.
21248,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"brienne: Move aside, Podrick."
21249,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,"podrick: backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
21250,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"brienne: You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
21251,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: I won't cut you. Don't worry.
21252,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
21253,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: I'll try not to.

BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
21255,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,brienne: Who taught you to do that?
21256,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,stark,stark: No one.

21260,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,snow: Who?

21265,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,snow,"snow: There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"

21289,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,missandei: Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

21291,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"missandei: I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."

A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
21346,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,lannister,lannister: Hold the line!

21380,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn: Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."

21391,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
21392,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: Step forward, My Lord."

21395,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,randyll: I already have a queen.
21396,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
21397,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,"randyll: There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
21398,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.

21412,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
21413,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
21414,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
21415,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
21416,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: I'm not beheading anyone.
21417,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
21418,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Your Grace --
21419,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
21420,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
21421,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
21422,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: Dracarys.
21423,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,drogon,drogon: draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
21424,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
21425,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,qyburn: My Lord.
21426,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
21427,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: How many men did we lose?
21428,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: We haven't done a full counting.
21429,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
21430,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: shakes his head.
21431,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
21432,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
21433,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
21434,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: turns and walks away from JAIME.
21435,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
21436,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: He didn't.
21437,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
21438,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
21439,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
21440,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: After all this time it still amazes me --
21441,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
21442,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
21443,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: After.
21444,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: And you believed her?
21445,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
21446,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: looks away, then sits down."
21447,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
21448,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
21449,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
21450,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
21451,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: They're beautiful, aren't they?"
21452,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,"snow: That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
21453,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
21454,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
21455,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: You weren't gone long.
21456,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: turns back to JON.
21457,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: No.
21458,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: And?
21459,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
21460,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: pauses and doesn't say anything.
21461,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: You're not sure how you feel about that?
21462,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,"snow: No, I'm not."
21463,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
21464,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
21465,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: Thousands.
21466,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
21467,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: Ser Davos gets carried away.
21468,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: So it was a figure of speech?
21469,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
21470,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"guard: This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
21471,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: He is my friend.
21472,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: kneels before DAENERYS.
21473,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: Your Grace.
21474,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: stands.
21475,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
21476,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I served with your father. He was a great man.
21477,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: nods to JON.
21478,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: You look strong. You found a cure?
21479,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,"mormont: I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
21480,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: It would be my honor.
21481,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: steps forward and hugs JORAH.
21482,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
21483,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Ravens. We need to send ravens.
21484,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,wolkan: nods his head to BRAN.
21485,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,archmaester,archmaester: MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
21486,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
21487,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
21488,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
21489,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
21490,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: stops working and turns around.
21491,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
21492,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,tarly: Brandon Stark --
21493,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,tarly: the crippled boy.
21494,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: Do you know him?
21495,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,tarly: I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
21496,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: And?
21497,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,"tarly: Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
21498,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
21499,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
21500,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,tarly: steps forward and clears his throat.
21501,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,"tarly: Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
21502,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
21503,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
21504,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,"tarly: Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
21505,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
21506,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tarly,tarly: Archmaester --
21507,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,"marwyn: That will be all, Tarley."
21508,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,sam: turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
21509,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"maester: It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
21510,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
21511,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
21512,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I'm afraid so.
21513,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,maester: Horrible business.
21514,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
21515,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
21516,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,marwyn: Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
21517,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
21518,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
21519,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Not burn him alive alongside his son.
21520,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
21521,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
21522,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys: reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
21523,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"varys: It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
21524,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
21525,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Daenerys is not her father.
21526,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
21527,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
21528,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Who is that for?
21529,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Jon Snow.
21530,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Did you read it?
21531,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
21532,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
21533,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: What's it say?
21534,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Nothing good.
21535,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
21536,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
21537,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
21538,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
21539,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
21540,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: interrupts VARYS.
21541,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I need to go home.
21542,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: You said you don't have enough men.
21543,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
21544,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
21545,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
21546,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
21547,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: begins walking around the table closer to JON.
21548,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: So bring the dead to her.
21549,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
21550,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
21551,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Is that possible?
21552,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
21553,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
21554,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.

21556,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: And how would you get into King's Landing.
21557,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
21558,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: nods his head.
21559,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,"targaryen: Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
21560,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,varys: Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
21561,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
21562,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
21563,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: turns to look at JORAH.
21564,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
21565,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
21566,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: They won't follow Ser Jorah.
21567,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: They won't have to.
21568,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
21569,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
21570,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: I haven't given you permission to leave.
21571,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,"snow: With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
21572,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,targaryen,targaryen: pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
21573,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,robett,"robett: The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."

21575,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
21576,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
21577,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
21578,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
21579,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
21580,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: These are mother and father's chambers.
21581,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: And?
21582,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Nothing.
21583,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Don't do that.
21584,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: turns around to face ARYA.
21585,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: What?
21586,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Say what you mean.
21587,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.

21589,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Are you angry with me?
21590,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
21591,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
21592,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Their opinions are important to you?
21593,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
21594,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: Not if they lose their heads first.
21595,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
21596,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
21597,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: How can you even think such a horrible thing?
21598,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,"stark: You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
21599,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
21600,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: I have work to do.
21601,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: turns and walks away from ARYA.
21602,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,stark,stark: My lady.

21604,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.

21606,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
21607,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
21608,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
21609,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
21610,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: You're not staying here?
21611,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
21612,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: What if someone takes the boat?
21613,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
21614,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
21615,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
21616,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
21617,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
21618,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: And here I am ready to train.
21619,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Why down here?
21620,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
21621,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
21622,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"bronn: Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
21623,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
21624,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: I'll leave you to it.
21625,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,bronn: turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.

21627,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: remains silent and stares at TYRION.
21628,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
21629,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Don't talk about our father.
21630,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Listen to me --
21631,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
21632,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
21633,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
21634,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: shakes his head and says nothing.
21635,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
21636,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: What do you want?
21637,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
21638,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
21639,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
21640,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I wasn't sure I'd find you.
21641,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I thought you might still be rowing.

21643,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
21644,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
21645,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
21646,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
21647,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Anybody give you any trouble?
21648,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
21649,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
21650,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: nods.
21651,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: You came to get me. You want me to come with you.

21654,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: You should know what you're heading into.
21655,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
21656,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
21657,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,"baratheon: I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."

21662,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: this I know.
21663,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
21664,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
21665,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
21666,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
21667,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Who should I say I am?
21668,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.

21673,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: It is.
21674,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
21675,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: The docks are that way.
21676,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
21677,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Still five gold dragons?
21678,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Are you joking?
21679,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: You must be even older than you look. 15.

21683,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
21684,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: turns and begins walking back to his boat.
21685,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: What's in the boat?
21686,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: pauses and turns back to the guards.
21687,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Not more gold.
21688,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Wine?
21689,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Mmm.
21690,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: I like wine.
21691,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Or hams.

21694,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: What?
21695,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
21696,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
21697,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
21698,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"guard: Oi, Dwarf!"

21700,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
21701,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: That dwarf --

21704,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
21705,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
21706,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Perhaps there's some arrangement?
21707,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,guard: Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
21708,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,"baratheon: can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."

21725,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?

21728,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Are you going to punish him?

21730,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Bronn.
21731,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: looks confused.
21732,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
21733,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: You let it happen. Why?
21734,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,"lannister: I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
21735,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.

21737,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: You.
21738,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: People won't like that.
21739,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
21740,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: Do you remember what father used to say about people?
21741,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,lannister,lannister: The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

21746,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: I understand.
21747,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
21748,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: You don't have to worry.
21749,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
21750,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Understood.
21751,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
21752,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: Begging your pardon, Your Grace."

21760,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: He was meant to keep that to himself.
21761,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
21762,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I saw your father once at Winterfell.
21763,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: I met yours in my shop.
21764,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: You're a lot leaner.
21765,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: You're a lot shorter.

21767,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: I grew up on stories about them.
21768,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,"baratheon: All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
21769,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
21770,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,"baratheon: No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
21771,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: Do you know how to use one?
21772,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: shakes his head.
21773,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,"snow: Well, that's a problem."
21774,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: I prefer a hammer.

21778,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: We could use the help.
21779,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"davos: As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
21780,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,"baratheon: I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."

21808,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly: Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --

But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
21811,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,gilly: Steps. That number was steps.

A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents."

21859,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
21860,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
21861,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
21862,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: He was my father.
21863,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: He hunted us like animals.
21864,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,"mormont: You returned the favor, as I recall."
21865,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
21866,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,davos: Our reasons aren't your reasons.
21867,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
21868,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
21869,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,beric: There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
21870,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,"sandor: For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
21871,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,mormont,mormont: Don't you want to know what we're doing?
21872,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,thoros: Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
21873,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: He's right. We're all on the same side.
21874,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,baratheon,baratheon: How can we be?
21875,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,snow,snow: We're all breathing.
21876,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,tormund: hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.
21877,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,end,end: CREDITS
21878,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Are you all right?
21879,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: faces JON and grunts.
21880,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Ever been north before?
21881,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: Never seen snow before.
21882,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
21883,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: You've never been down south.
21884,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I've been to Winterfell.
21885,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: That's the north.
21886,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
21887,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
21888,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
21889,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
21890,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: We have to make due with what we've got.
21891,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
21892,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: This one is maybe not so smart.
21893,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Davos says he is a strong fighter.
21894,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Good. That's more important than being smart.
21895,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: looks at JON as they continue to walk.
21896,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
21897,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
21898,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
21899,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros: Are you still mad at us, boy?"
21900,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: You sold me to a witch.
21901,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"thoros: Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
21902,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
21903,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,"baratheon: I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
21904,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Sounds all right so far.
21905,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: and put leeches on me.
21906,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Was she naked too?
21907,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: She needed your blood.
21908,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: Yes. Thank you. I know that.
21909,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
21910,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: It could have been worse.
21911,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
21912,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"sandor: But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
21913,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,baratheon,baratheon: I'm not whinging.
21914,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
21915,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: motions to BERIC.
21916,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
21917,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
21918,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: Good lad.
21919,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
21920,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
21921,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
21922,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,"mormont: I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
21923,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
21924,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: Your father wanted to execute me.
21925,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I heard.
21926,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
21927,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: and JON glance at each other.
21928,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I'm glad he didn't capture you.
21929,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: Me too.
21930,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
21931,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,"snow: Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
21932,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
21933,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
21934,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
21935,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
21936,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,"mormont: pauses, then nods at JON."
21937,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: He gave it to you.
21938,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I'm not his son.
21939,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,"mormont: pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
21940,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
21941,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
21942,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,mormont,mormont: I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
21943,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
21944,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I remember.
21945,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,"stark: One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
21946,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: starts a slow clap.
21947,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
21948,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: turns to look at ARYA.
21949,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: What?
21950,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
21951,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,"stark: That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
21952,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: You don't have to read it. I remember.
21953,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,"stark: Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
21954,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: They forced me to do it.
21955,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
21956,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
21957,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
21958,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: They told me it was the only way to save father.
21959,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
21960,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: You were there?
21961,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
21962,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
21963,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I wanted to.
21964,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: But you didn't. Just like me.
21965,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
21966,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,"stark: You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
21967,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I was training.

21970,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: You never would have survived what I survived.
21971,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I guess we'll never know.
21972,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: What are you doing to do with that letter.
21973,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: I don't know yet.
21974,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?

21977,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

21979,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,"stark: The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
21980,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
21981,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,stark,stark: Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.

21994,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: I didn't trip. I was pushed.
21995,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Ever since you've been mean.
21996,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Will you fuck off?
21997,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.

21999,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?

22005,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
22006,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: stops and glances at TORMUND.
22007,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: Brienne of Tarth.
22008,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: You know her?
22009,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22010,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"tormund: Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22011,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22012,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: nods.
22013,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: You do know her.
22014,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: We've met.
22015,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: and TORMUND begin walking.
22016,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
22017,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22018,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,tormund: I'm good at killing people.
22019,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: You don't much look like him.
22020,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Who's that?
22021,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
22022,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: You knew him?
22023,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
22024,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I serve the north.
22025,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22026,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
22027,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: He wants you alive.
22028,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Why?
22029,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: I don't know.
22030,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,"snow: That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22031,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22032,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: So what are you fighting for?
22033,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
22034,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: But we all die.
22035,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22036,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
22037,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,beric: Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
22038,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,snow,snow: Aye. Maybe that's enough.
22039,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
22040,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: That's what I saw in the fire.
22041,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: points towards the mountain.
22042,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: A mountain like an arrowhead.
22043,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,thoros: Are you sure?
22044,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: turns to THOROS and nods his head.
22045,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,sandor: We're getting close.
22046,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,lannister: is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
22047,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,targaryen,targaryen: Do you know what I like about you?
22048,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,lannister: turns to look at DAENERYS.
22049,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,lannister: I honestly don't.
22050,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,targaryen,targaryen: You're not a hero.
22051,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,lannister: Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
22052,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,targaryen,targaryen: walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
22053,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,lannister: I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22054,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,targaryen,"targaryen: I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22055,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,"lannister: It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22056,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,targaryen,targaryen: Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22057,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,lannister,"lannister: Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22058,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Oil?
22059,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: Pitch, my lord."
22060,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: How many barrels?
22061,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: 500, my lord."
22062,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Get 500 more.
22063,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"soldier: Yes, my lord."
22064,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22065,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: The thrill will fade.
22066,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22067,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Gold?
22068,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22069,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Family.
22070,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Not without a cock, you don't."
22071,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22072,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Yet, your brother--"
22073,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22074,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22075,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"man: Archers, stand tall!"
22076,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,man: Cover that wall!
22077,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: How many people live here?
22078,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: A million, give or take."
22079,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22080,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22081,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Why isn't she with them?
22082,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22083,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And the rest of them?
22084,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,qyburn: They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22085,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Including our brother.
22086,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"qyburn: Yes, Your Grace."
22087,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
22088,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,missandei,missandei: Why did they build it?
22089,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,mormont,"mormont: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22090,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22091,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: Maybe it still is.
22092,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22093,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22094,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22095,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"podrick: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22096,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Supporting the enemy, no less."
22097,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick: Hard to blame you.
22098,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Cersei will anyway.
22099,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,podrick: I'm glad you're alive.
22100,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22101,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,soldier: What's in there?
22102,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Fuck off.
22103,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: I thought you were dead.
22104,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Not yet. You came pretty close.
22105,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: I was only trying to protect her.
22106,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: You and me both.
22107,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: She's alive. Arya.
22108,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Where?
22109,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: Winterfell.
22110,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: Who's protecting her if you're here?
22111,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22112,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: It won't be me.
22113,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22114,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"podrick: It is, my lord."
22115,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22116,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: I'm sure your new queen--
22117,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You've been thinking about our new queen.
22118,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"varys: And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22119,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,bronn: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22120,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22121,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22122,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: It's good to see you again.
22123,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Yeah, you, too."
22124,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor: Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22125,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"bronn: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22126,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22127,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You might.
22128,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,sandor: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22129,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22130,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"sandor: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
22131,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Where is she?
22132,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: She'll be here soon.
22133,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Didn't travel with you?
22134,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: No.
22135,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: We've been here for some time.
22136,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: My apologies.
22137,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: We are all facing a unique
22138,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: Theon! I have your sister
22139,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22140,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22141,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22142,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,"greyjoy: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22143,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22144,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: Why?
22145,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Sit down or leave.
22146,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22147,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22148,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: We all know that will never happen.
22149,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Then why are we here?
22150,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22151,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22152,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22153,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22154,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: Yes. That's all.
22155,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22156,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22157,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: The word of a would-be usurper.
22158,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22159,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: We can destroy them by burning them.
22160,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,"snow: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22161,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22162,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22163,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: How many?
22164,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,"targaryen: A hundred thousand, at least."
22165,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: Can they swim?
22166,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: No.
22167,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22168,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: What are you talking about?
22169,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22170,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22171,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22172,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: In return, the King"
22173,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: Just the King
22174,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22175,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22176,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22177,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: Ser Jaime.
22178,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22179,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22180,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22181,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,"brienne: Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22182,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Fuck loyalty?
22183,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,brienne: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22184,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And tell her what?
22185,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: I wish you hadn't done that.
22186,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,"targaryen: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22187,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: I know!
22188,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
22189,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
22190,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22191,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,davos: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22192,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22193,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
22194,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22195,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: I did this. I should go.
22196,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
22197,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You spoke with her?
22198,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22199,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22200,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22201,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22202,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22203,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22204,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I didn't know about that.
22205,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22206,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Cersei, I didn't know."
22207,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: the destruction of this family.
22208,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22209,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You killed our father
22210,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22211,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
22212,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I have never been more sorry about anything.
22213,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I will not hear it, not from you."
22214,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I will not hear it!
22215,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22216,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
22217,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22218,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I will not
22219,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22220,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22221,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22222,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22223,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22224,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22225,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Mm, not like this."
22226,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22227,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Yes.
22228,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Why?
22229,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22230,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22231,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22232,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22233,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22234,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You're pregnant.
22235,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: No one is less happy about this than I am.
22236,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,"targaryen: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22237,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,"targaryen: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22238,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22239,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: I can't have children.
22240,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: Who told you that?
22241,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: The witch who murdered my husband.
22242,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22243,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,"targaryen: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22244,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,"snow: So, what now?"
22245,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22246,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22247,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22248,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22249,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,"stark: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22250,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22251,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,"stark: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22252,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22253,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: What does that have to do with anything?
22254,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22255,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: You think he wants to marry her?
22256,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,"baelish: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22257,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,"stark: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22258,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,"baelish: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22259,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22260,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,"baelish: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22261,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22262,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: She's your sister
22263,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22264,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: Why did she come to Winterfell?
22265,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22266,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,baelish: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22267,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22268,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,baelish,"baelish: And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22269,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: Lady

Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22273,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,"snow: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22274,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,targaryen,targaryen: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.

22278,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,"greyjoy: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22279,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22280,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,"greyjoy: You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."

22284,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,greyjoy,greyjoy: I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22285,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,snow,snow: Our father was more of a father.

That's what you did to our mother."

22359,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
22360,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
22361,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
22362,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
22363,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
22364,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
22365,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--

22367,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Our child will rule Westeros.
22368,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
22369,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
22370,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And then what?
22371,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And then we rule.
22372,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
22373,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
22374,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
22375,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: How many dragons did you see at the pit?
22376,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Two.
22377,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: What happened to the third?
22378,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
22379,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
22380,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
22381,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
22382,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
22383,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
22384,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
22385,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,"lannister: And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
22386,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I didn't conspire with him.
22387,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
22388,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
22389,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: And that will be treason.
22390,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Treason?
22391,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Disobeying your queen
22392,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
22393,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lannister,lannister: I told you no one walks away from me.

22434,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
22435,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,"stark: Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
22436,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,"stark: In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."

22438,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,stark,stark: I miss him.

22441,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tormund,tormund: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

22444,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tormund,tormund: Come on! Run! Run!
22445,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
22446,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"varys: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
22447,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: Because I have balls, and you don't."
22448,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
22449,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: Look at you.
22450,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: You're a man.
22451,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: Almost.
22452,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: Where's Arya?
22453,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: Lurking somewhere.

22463,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
22464,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.

22468,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: A lord? Nothing at all?
22469,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: It's not important.
22470,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,lyanna: Not important? We named you King in the North.
22471,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,man: King of the North!

But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."

Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
22474,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
22475,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,"stark: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"

22486,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.

22491,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.

22495,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: And you believed her?
22496,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
22497,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
22498,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: You used to be taller.
22499,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: How did you sneak up on me?
22500,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: How did you survive a knife through the heart?
22501,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: I didn't.

22506,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: Valyrian steel.
22507,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: Jealous?
22508,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: Too heavy for me.

22516,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: Yeah. I'm her family too.
22517,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,stark,stark: Don't forget that.

22520,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
22521,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
22522,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
22523,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
22524,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Are we in King's Landing?
22525,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Mm.
22526,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: You picked the losing side.
22527,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
22528,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

22532,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Horses?
22533,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,harry: Two thousand.
22534,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: And elephants?

22536,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
22537,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"harry: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
22538,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."

22541,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
22542,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
22543,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: I was hoping we could talk in private.
22544,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: After the war. That was our agreement.
22545,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Wars sometimes last years.
22546,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
22547,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: How?
22548,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,"greyjoy: I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
22549,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
22550,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: They were lesser men.
22551,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
22552,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
22553,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,"dirah: Archie, was it?"
22554,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: And William.

22556,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,"crayah: Yeah, tall handsome William."
22557,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
22558,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
22559,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: Did you?
22560,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: Nearly killed it.
22561,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,marei,marei: That's brave.
22562,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: That boy Eddie.
22563,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: The ginger?
22564,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
22565,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,dirah: How does he sleep with no eyelids?
22566,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
22567,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
22568,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: You're kidding me.

22571,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,crayah: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
22572,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
22573,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: Which girl?
22574,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
22575,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
22576,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
22577,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"

22579,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"bronn: Yeah, well, good luck with that."
22580,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
22581,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,qyburn: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
22582,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,bronn: That fucking family.
22583,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"qyburn: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"

22585,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,"greyjoy: So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
22586,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: You're insulting my late husband?
22587,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Are you offended?
22588,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,"lannister: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
22589,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: And the Kingslayer?

22594,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
22595,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: But now I want to be alone.
22596,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

22599,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Daenerys went north.
22600,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
22601,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: You're my queen. I go where you command.
22602,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
22603,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,greyjoy,greyjoy: What is dead may never die.

22608,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,davos: Can't argue with that.
22609,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
22610,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: And our queen is grateful.
22611,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
22612,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
22613,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"davos: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"

22615,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
22616,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: I'm not that old.
22617,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Not as old as him.
22618,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
22619,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"varys: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
22620,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lannister,lannister: What is that?
22621,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,varys: Nothing lasts.

22629,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: What's wrong with them?
22630,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,targaryen,targaryen: They don't like the North.
22631,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,targaryen,targaryen: Go on.
22632,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: I don't know how to ride a dragon.

22639,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,targaryen,targaryen: We could stay a thousand years-
22640,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,targaryen,targaryen: No one would find us.
22641,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: We'd be pretty old.
22642,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,snow,snow: It's cold up here for a southern girl.
22643,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,targaryen,targaryen: So keep your queen warm.

22831,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.

22835,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: I am.
22836,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: She didn't seem sure about you.
22837,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
22838,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: Hmm.
22839,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
22840,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: Was she lying about the baby too?
22841,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,"lannister: No, that part is real."
22842,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
22843,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: What?
22844,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,"lannister: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."

22848,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: My cock.
22849,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
22850,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.

22855,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lannister,lannister: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

22873,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: Long ago and long forgiven.
22874,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,mormont,"mormont: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."

22877,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
22878,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,mormont,mormont: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
22879,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,mormont,mormont: But the mind behind all those words-
22880,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
22881,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,mormont,mormont: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.

22886,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,"targaryen: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
22887,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.

22890,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,stark,stark: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
22891,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
22892,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,"targaryen: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."

22894,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: I thought he knew his sister.

22896,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,targaryen: Ours certainly have been.
22897,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,stark,stark: A sad thing to have in common.
22898,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,"targaryen: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."

22904,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,stark,stark: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
22905,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,targaryen,"targaryen: I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."

It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath.

23343,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,"lannister: We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"

23347,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,lannister: So did you?
23348,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,"davos: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
23349,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,lannister: I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
23350,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,davos: And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
23351,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,"lannister: Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."

23355,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,stark,stark: It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
23356,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,lannister: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
23357,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,stark,stark: I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
23358,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,lannister,lannister: You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

23402,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
23403,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,targaryen,targaryen: You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
23404,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: It was a mistake.
23405,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,targaryen,targaryen: Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?

23419,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,targaryen,targaryen: She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.

23426,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
23427,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,targaryen,targaryen: They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
23428,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
23429,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,targaryen,targaryen: Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.

23466,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: Did you consider taking it off?

23468,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: And you're going back to her, to die with her."
23469,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: You've underestimated her before.
23470,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
23471,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: Difficult to do from here.
23472,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
23473,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
23474,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
23475,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
23476,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
23477,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."

23482,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
23483,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: Why?
23484,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
23485,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
23486,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."

23488,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,lannister: You have my word.
23489,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister,"lannister: If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."

23717,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
23718,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,"snow: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
23719,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."

23722,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,snow: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
23723,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: And she burned down a city for it.

23729,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."

23731,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
23732,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
23733,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.

23736,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,snow: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
23737,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"

23739,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,snow: That's her decision. She is the queen.
23740,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,snow: I'm sorry it came to this.

23743,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

23745,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
23746,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,targaryen,"targaryen: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
23747,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,snow,snow: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
23748,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,targaryen,targaryen: It was necessary.

23750,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,targaryen,targaryen: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.

23752,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,targaryen,"targaryen: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"

Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."

Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.

23892,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?

23894,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,"lannister: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
23895,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,davos: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
23896,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"bronn: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."

23906,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,brienne: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
23907,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,bronn: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
23908,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,lannister,lannister: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
